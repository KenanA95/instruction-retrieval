Differentiate f(j) wrt j.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Find the value of q\nGiven that q = -41 - (-69), we can simplify this expression by combining the constants:\nq = -41 + 69 = 28.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for o\nWe are given that -6 = 2o + 2. To solve for o, we need to isolate o on one side of the equation. Subtract 2 from both sides:\n-6 - 2 = 2o + 2 - 2\n-8 = 2o\nDivide both sides by 2:\n-8/2 = 2o/2\n-4 = o\n\n## Step 3: Find the value of z\nWe are given that 4z + 2o = q. Substitute the value of q and o into this equation:\n4z + 2(-4) = 28\n4z - 8 = 28\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n4z = 28 + 8\n4z = 36\nDivide both sides by 4:\n4z/4 = 36/4\nz = 9\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of x(k)\nWe are given that x(k) = k - 3. However, we do not have a specific value for k. Since we are asked to find the derivative of f(j) wrt j, we will assume that we are finding the derivative of f(p) wrt p, where p is a variable. In this case, we can assume that k = p.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of g(p)\nWe are given that g(h) = 5h - 12. However, we are asked to find the derivative of f(p) wrt j, where f(p) = z*x(p) - 2*g(p). We will assume that g(p) = g(h) since the variable names are the same.\n\n## Step 6: Find the value of f(p)\nSubstitute the values of z, x(p), and g(p) into the expression for f(p):\nf(p) = 9*(p - 3) - 2*(5p - 12)\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for f(p)\nExpand the expression:\nf(p) = 9p - 27 - 10p + 24\nCombine like terms:\nf(p) = -p - 3\n\n## Step 8: Find the derivative of f(p) wrt p\nDifferentiate the expression for f(p) with respect to p:\nf'(p) = d(-p - 3)/dp\nf'(p) = -1\n\n## Step 9: Find the derivative of f(j) wrt j\nSince we are asked to find the derivative of f(j) wrt j, we can substitute j for p:\nf'(j) = f'(p) = -1\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$",

Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  \n3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  \n4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  \n5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  \n6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  \n7.

The derivative of \\( -\\frac{2j^7}{70} \\) is \\( -\\frac{14j^6}{70} \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{j^5}{40} \\) is \\( -\\frac{5j^4}{40} \\).\n3.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as we were asked to find the third derivative of q(z) with respect to z, but q(z) is actually the second derivative of c(j) with respect to j. Assuming the intention was to find the third derivative of c(j) with respect to j, we proceed with that.\n\n### Step 6: Find the Third Derivative of c(j)\n\nDifferentiate the second derivative of c(j) with respect to j:\n\n1. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{j^6}{5} \\) is \\( -\\frac{6j^5}{5} \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{j^4}{8} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4j^3}{8} \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( -6j \\) is \\( -6 \\).\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\\[ -\\frac{6j^5}{5} - \\frac{j^3}{2} - 6 \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the third derivative of q(z) with respect to z, and q(z) is actually the second derivative of c(j) with respect to j, we cannot directly apply the above steps. The correct approach would be to find the third derivative of c(j) with respect to j and then find the derivative of that result with respect to z. But since the problem statement is unclear, I will provide the third derivative of c(j) as the final answer.\n\nReasoning: The problem statement is unclear, and there seems to be a mistake in the problem. The correct approach would be to find the third derivative of c(j) with respect to j and then find the derivative of that result with respect to z. However, since q(z) is the second derivative of c(j) with respect to j, we cannot directly apply the above steps.\n\nFinal Answer: -\\frac{6j^5}{5} - \\frac{j^3}{2} - 6",

Since we found that \\( q = 1 \\), we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n\\[ -1 = -l + 1 \\]\n\\[ l = 2 \\]\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the second derivative of \\( k + 4 + 3k^l - 4 \\) with respect to \\( k \\).

We then used the equation \\( -q = -l + 1 \\) to find \\( l = 2 \\). With \\( l = 2 \\), we simplified the expression to \\( 3k^2 + k \\) and found its first derivative with respect to \\( k \\), which was \\( 6k + 1 \\). Finally, we found the second derivative of the expression with respect to \\( k \\), which was \\( 6 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 6.",

The derivative of \\( p \\) is \\( 1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.\n\nSince there are no products, quotients, or composite functions in this case, we only apply the power rule.\n\n### Step 5: Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4p^3}{6} - \\frac{3p^2}{6} + 1\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2p^3}{3} - \\frac{p^2}{2} + 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.\n\nWe need to find the second derivative, so we differentiate the expression again:\n\n1. The derivative of \\( \\frac{2p^3}{3} \\) is \\( \\frac{6p^2}{3} \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{p^2}{2} \\) is \\( -p \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( 1 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[\n2p^2 - p\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Check if the result can be further simplified\n\nThe expression \\( 2p^2 - p \\) cannot be simplified further.\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of \\( o(y) \\) with respect to \\( y \\) is:\n\n\\[\n2y^2 - y\n\\]\n\nReasoning: \nThe given function is \\( o(p) = \\frac{p^4}{6} - \\frac{p^3}{6} + p \\). To find the second derivative of \\( o(y) \\) with respect to \\( y \\), we first simplify the expression and then differentiate it twice. The first derivative is \\( \\frac{2p^3}{3} - \\frac{p^2}{2} + 1 \\), and the second derivative is \\( 2p^2 - p \\). Since the variable in the original function is \\( p \\), we replace \\( p \\) with \\( y \\) to get the second derivative of \\( o(y) \\) with respect to \\( y \\), which is \\( 2y^2 - y \\).\n\nFinal Answer: 2*y**2 - y",

Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  \n3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  \n4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  \n5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  \n6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  \n7. Always check if the result can be further simplified (for instance, by factoring out common terms).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

We first find the first derivative \\( b(p) \\) with respect to \\( p \\), which is \\( 4p^4 - 19p \\). Then, we find the second derivative of \\( b(p) \\) with respect to \\( p \\), which is \\( 16p^3 - 19 \\).

Since the original function is in terms of f, we should express f in terms of v. But, the problem does not provide a direct relationship between f and v. Therefore, we cannot directly substitute f with v.\n\nAssuming the original function is actually in terms of v, the correct answer would be in terms of v. However, without a clear relationship between f and v, we cannot provide a numerical answer.\n\nAnswer: 2*v**4 - 2\n\nReasoning: The problem does not provide a clear relationship between f and v, so we cannot directly substitute f with v in the expression 2f^4 - 2.

However, I'll address the derivative part of the question as it seems to be the main focus.\n\nGiven the expression \\( j^5 + j - 2j + b*j \\), let's simplify it first:\n\n\\[ j^5 + j - 2j + b*j = j^5 + (1 - 2 + b)*j = j^5 + (b - 1)*j \\]\n\n### Step 1: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the derivative of \\( j^5 + (b - 1)*j \\) with respect to \\( j \\), we'll apply the power rule for the first term and the sum rule for the second term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( j^5 \\) is \\( 5j^4 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( (b - 1)*j \\) is \\( (b - 1) \\), since the derivative of \\( j \\) is \\( 1 \\).\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\\[ 5j^4 + (b - 1) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the Second Derivative\n\nTo find the second derivative, we differentiate the first derivative with respect to \\( j \\):\n\n- The derivative of \\( 5j^4 \\) is \\( 20j^3 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( (b - 1) \\) is \\( 0 \\), since the derivative of a constant is \\( 0 \\).\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\\[ 20j^3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of the given expression with respect to \\( j \\) is:\n\\[ 20j^3 \\]\n\nReasoning: The initial part of the question about finding \\( h \\) and its relation to \\( b \\) seems to be a distraction from the main task of finding the derivative of the given expression with respect to \\( j \\). The expression \\( -5*b + 4*w = 4 \\) and \\( -h*w + 6 = 3*b + 3 \\) do not directly relate to the derivative of \\( j^5 + j - 2j + b*j \\) with respect to \\( j \\).

Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  \n3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  \n4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  \n5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  \n6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  \n7.

However, I noticed that the problem statement contains multiple variables (j, g, r, h) and a mix of equations and a function to find the third derivative.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify the function you want to differentiate and the specific variable with respect to which you are differentiating.  \n2. Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  \n3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  \n4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  \n5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  \n6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  \n7. Always check if the result can be further simplified (for instance, by factoring out common terms).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  \n3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  \n4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  \n5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  \n6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  \n7.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify the function you want to differentiate and the specific variable with respect to which you are differentiating.  \n2. Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  \n3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  \n4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  \n5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  \n6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  \n7. Always check if the result can be further simplified (for instance, by factoring out common terms).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(a) be the second derivative of a**7/70 - 3*a**6/40 + a**5/10 + 9*a**2/2 - 4*a.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(i) be the third derivative of -i**5/24 + 5*i**4/48 + 5*i**3/6 + 9*i**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l = 36 - 26.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l(y) be the third derivative of -y**6/120 + 6*y**2.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Determine t, given that 1/10*t**2 + 3/5*t + 9/10 = 0.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Examine the polynomial to determine its degree.\nThe given polynomial is 1/10*t**2 + 3/5*t + 9/10.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(u) be the first derivative of -u**6/54 + u**4/36 + 13.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let d(c) be the third derivative of -c**8/10080 + c**7/2016 - c**6/1440 + c**5/30 - 7*c**2.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(h) = -8*h - 2 + 7*h**2 + 3 - 1 + h**3.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = 3*m + 207 - 222.

However, I'll do my best to provide a solution based on the information given.\n\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[ 0 = 3m + 207 - 222 \\]\n\nFirst, simplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 0 = 3m - 15 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[ 3m = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 5 \\]\n\nNow, let's address the second part of the problem, which seems to be a polynomial equation in terms of \\(i\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{104}{3}i^2 - \\frac{434}{3}i^4 + 0 + \\frac{92}{3}i^3 - 196i^m + 16i = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement, as the powers of \\(i\\) are not consistent. Typically, \\(i\\) is defined as the imaginary unit with the property that \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), and \\(i^4 = 1\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor -32 - 224*l**2 + 163*l + 13*l + 30*l**3 - 56*l**2 + 70*l**3.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Simplify the given expression\nThe given expression is -32 - 224*l**2 + 163*l + 13*l + 30*l**3 - 56*l**2 + 70*l**3.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let h(a) be the third derivative of a**8/168 + a**7/35 - 2*a**5/15 + 11*a**2.

Assuming the intention is to find the value of \"a\" that makes h(a) = 0, I'll proceed with the solution.\n\n## Step 1: Find the First Derivative of h(a)\nTo find the third derivative of h(a), we first need to find the first derivative of h(a).\n\n## Step 2: Differentiate Each Term\nThe function h(a) is:\n\\[ h(a) = \\frac{a^8}{168} + \\frac{a^7}{35} - \\frac{2a^5}{15} + 11a^2 \\]\n\nDifferentiating each term with respect to a:\n\\[ h'(a) = \\frac{8a^7}{168} + \\frac{7a^6}{35} - \\frac{10a^4}{15} + 22a \\]\n\n## Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\nDifferentiate h'(a) to find the second derivative h''(a):\n\\[ h''(a) = \\frac{56a^6}{168} + \\frac{42a^5}{35} - \\frac{40a^3}{15} + 22 \\]\n\n## Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\nDifferentiate h''(a) to find the third derivative h'''(a):\n\\[ h'''(a) = \\frac{336a^5}{168} + \\frac{210a^4}{35} - \\frac{120a^2}{15} \\]\n\n## Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\nSet h'''(a) equal to zero and solve for a:\n\\[ \\frac{336a^5}{168} + \\frac{210a^4}{35} - \\frac{120a^2}{15} = 0 \\]\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the Equation\nMultiply both sides by 420 to eliminate the fractions:\n\\[ 840a^5 + 5040a^4 - 3360a^2 = 0 \\]\n\n## Step 7: Factor the Equation\nFactor out the greatest common factor, which is 336a^2:\n\\[ 336a^2(a^3 + 15a^2 - 10) = 0 \\]\n\n## Step 8: Solve for a\nSet each factor equal to zero and solve for a:\n\\[ 336a^2 = 0 \\] or \\[ a^3 + 15a^2 - 10 = 0 \\]\n\n## Step 9: Solve the Cubic Equation\nThe cubic equation a^3 + 15a^2 - 10 = 0 can be solved by inspection or numerical methods.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l be (-16)/6*(-7 + (-1140)/(-168)).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose -5*d - 7 + 22 = 0.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = -6*t + 3*t - 3*i + 9, 0 = -2*t + 3*i + 1.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let w(k) be the third derivative of -k**7/105 + k**6/360 + k**5/60 - k**4/4 - 9*k**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z(j) be the third derivative of 1/18*j**4 - 3*j**2 - 1/3*j**3 + 0*j - 1/270*j**5 + 0.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let a = -4 - -6.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f(g) be the second derivative of g**6/30 + 6*g.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(c) be the third derivative of -c**8/84 + c**6/30 + 5*c**2.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor 32/5*r + 6/5*r**2 + 2.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor\nThe first step is to factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from the given expression.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let x(y) = y**2 + y - 5.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let o(s) be the second derivative of s**6/30 + 4*s**5/15 + 2*s**4/3 + 5*s**3/6 + s.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let 0*h**3 + 0 + 1/2*h**4 + 0*h - 1/2*h**2 = 0.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l(g) be the third derivative of -g**8/11760 - g**7/4410 + g**6/1260 + g**5/210 - g**4/8 + 9*g**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let y be 39/(-12) + (-2)/(-8).

Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(i) = i - 2.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get p = 2/9.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute p into the original equation\nWe can substitute p = 2/9 into the original equation -l**s - 4*l**4 + 6*l**4 - l**2 = 0. This gives us -l**(-5 + 9) - 4*l**4 + 6*l**4 - l**2 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation -l**(-5 + 9) - 4*l**4 + 6*l**4 - l**2 = 0, we get l**4 - l**2 = 0.\n\n## Step 9: Factor the equation\nFactoring the equation l**4 - l**2 = 0, we get l**2*(l**2 - 1) = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for l\nSolving the equation l**2*(l**2 - 1) = 0, we get l**2 = 0 or l**2 - 1 = 0. Solving for l, we get l = 0 or l = \u00b11.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let y(v) be the third derivative of -v**6/180 - v**5/45 - v**4/36 + 54*v**2 - 1.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor 0 + 1/2*y**4 + 0*y**3 + 0*y - 1/2*y**2.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor\nThe given expression is 0 + 1/2*y**4 + 0*y**3 + 0*y - 1/2*y**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u(p) = -3 + 0*p + p**3 - 2*p**2 - p - p.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

First, subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to get -12 = -5*s + 2*x. Then, add 5*s to both sides to get -12 + 5*s = 2*x. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to get x = (-12 + 5*s)/2.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the second equation for x\nTo solve the equation -4*s + 10 = 2*x - 4*x for x, we need to isolate x. First, add 4*x to both sides of the equation to get -4*s + 10 + 4*x = 2*x. Then, subtract 2*x from both sides to get -4*s + 10 = -2*x. Finally, divide both sides by -2 to get x = 2*s - 5.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation\nSubstitute x = (-12 + 5*s)/2 into the equation x = 2*s - 5. We get (-12 + 5*s)/2 = 2*s - 5.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the resulting equation for s\nTo solve the equation (-12 + 5*s)/2 = 2*s - 5 for s, first multiply both sides by 2 to get -12 + 5*s = 4*s - 10. Then, subtract 4*s from both sides to get -12 + s = -10. Finally, add 12 to both sides to get s = 2.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the value of s into the expression for x\nSubstitute s = 2 into the expression x = 2*s - 5. We get x = 2*2 - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the third equation for h\nTo solve the equation h**3 + h + 4*h**2 - 2*h**2 + 0*h**s = 0 for h, we need to simplify the equation. First, combine like terms to get h**3 + 2*h**2 + 0*h**s = 0. Then, factor out h**2 to get h**2*(h + 2) = 0.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for h\nTo solve the equation h**2*(h + 2) = 0, we need to find the values of h that make the equation true. First, set each factor equal to 0. We get h**2 = 0 and h + 2 = 0. Solving for h in each equation, we get h = 0 and h = -2.\n\n## Step 8: List all the solutions\nThe solutions to the equations are x = -1, s = 2, and h = 0, h = -2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-2}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let w(n) = -2*n - 2.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l(n) = 2*n - 1.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Examine the polynomial to determine its degree (the highest exponent).  \n2. Simplify the polynomial if necessary, combining like terms and putting it into standard form.  \n3. If the polynomial is quadratic (degree 2):  \n   a. Try to factor it by finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the linear term, if it factors easily.  \n   b. If factoring directly is not possible, use the quadratic formula:  \n      x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a).  \n4. If the polynomial is cubic (degree 3) or higher:  \n   a. Look for a common factor that can be factored out.  \n   b. Apply techniques such as grouping, synthetic division, or the Rational Root Theorem to find potential rational roots.  \n   c. Use polynomial long division or synthetic division with any discovered roots to reduce the polynomial\u2019s degree.  \n   d. Continue factoring the reduced polynomial.  \n5.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let q(w) = -w**3 - 8*w**2 + 10*w + 12.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor 1/2*w**2 + 0 + 0*w**3 - 1/2*w**4 + 0*w.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Identify the polynomial\nThe given polynomial is \\( \\frac{1}{2}w^2 - \\frac{1}{2}w^4 \\).\n\n## Step 2: Factor out the greatest common factor\nThe greatest common factor of the terms is \\( \\frac{1}{2}w^2 \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let h(m) be the second derivative of -m**6/10 - 11*m**5/20 - 5*m**4/4 - 3*m**3/2 - m**2 - 5*m.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let o be 6/3*-1 + 9.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z be (-4)/14 - 423/(-1260).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let g(k) be the second derivative of -k**4/4 - k**3/2 - 18*k.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor 3 + 9/2*u**2 + 27/4*u + 3/4*u**3.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Examine the polynomial to determine its degree.\nThe given polynomial is 3 + 9/2*u**2 + 27/4*u + 3/4*u**3.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 4*t = -3*z + 8, 10 = -0*t + 5*t.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v = 6 + -2.

The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v be 2/(-30)*(-2)/20.

What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

However, I need to clarify that the problem statement seems to be incomplete or improperly formatted. It appears to be a collection of equations and a question about prime factors, but the equations don't seem to be related to each other in a way that would allow for a straightforward solution.\n\nGiven the format you requested, I'll choose one of the equations and solve it step by step. Let's take the first equation:\n\np - 4*y - 14 = -2\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable p\n\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving p on one side of the equation. Let's move the term 4y from the right side to the left side by adding 4y to both sides:\n\n\\[\np - 4y - 14 + 4y = -2 + 4y\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\np - 14 = 4y - 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for p\n\nNow, we need to solve for p by adding 14 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\np - 14 + 14 = 4y - 2 + 14\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\np = 4y + 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of p\n\nSince we have p expressed as \\( p = 4y + 12 \\), we need to find the prime factors of \\( 4y + 12 \\). However, without knowing the value of y, we cannot determine the prime factors of p directly.\n\nLet's choose a value for y to proceed with an example. Suppose y = 1.\n\n### Step 4: Substitute y = 1 into the equation for p\n\n\\[\np = 4(1) + 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 4 + 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Find the prime factors of p\n\nThe number 16 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n16 = 2 \\times 8\n\\]\n\nFurther, 8 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n8 = 2 \\times 4\n\\]\n\nAnd 4 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n4 = 2 \\times 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the prime factors of 16 are 2, 2, 2, and 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe prime factors of p are 2, 2, 2, and 2.\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 2, 2\n\nPlease note that this solution is based on a specific value of y chosen for demonstration purposes.

Check if 2 divides the number without leaving a remainder.  \n   \u2022 If yes, note 2 as a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until it no longer divides evenly.  \n   \u2022 If no, move on to the next prime number (3, then 5, 7, 11, and so on).  \n4. Continue checking divisibility by each prime, noting it as a factor and dividing out the prime repeatedly until it no longer divides.  \n5. Stop when your reduced number is 1. The prime factors you recorded are the distinct prime factors of the original number.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the denominator\nThe denominator is \\(21/(-3164)\\). We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 21.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the simplification\nSimplifying the numerator gives us \\((-6)/4 = -3/2\\).\n\nSimplifying the denominator gives us \\(21/(-3164) = -1/(-152)\\).\n\n## Step 6: Rewrite the expression with the simplified fractions\nNow we have \\((-3/2)/(-1/(-152))\\).\n\n## Step 7: Invert and multiply to divide\nTo divide by a fraction, we invert the second fraction and multiply.\n\n## Step 8: Invert the second fraction\nInverting \\((-1/(-152))\\) gives us \\((-152/-1)\\).\n\n## Step 9: Multiply the fractions\nNow we multiply \\((-3/2) \\times (-152/-1)\\).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the multiplication\nMultiplying the numerators gives us \\((-3) \\times (-152) = 456\\).\n\nMultiplying the denominators gives us \\(2 \\times (-1) = -2\\).\n\n## Step 11: Write the result of the multiplication\nSo, \\((-3/2) \\times (-152/-1) = 456/-2\\).\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the result\nSimplifying \\(456/-2\\) gives us \\(-228\\).\n\n## Step 13: Find the prime factors of -228\nNow we need to find the prime factors of \\(-228\\). Since prime factors are typically considered for positive numbers, we'll find the prime factors of \\(228\\) and then consider the negative sign separately.\n\n## Step 14: Factor 228\n\\(228 = 2 \\times 114\\).\n\n## Step 15: Continue factoring\n\\(114 = 2 \\times 57\\).\n\n## Step 16: Continue factoring\n\\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\).\n\n## Step 17: Write the prime factorization of 228\nSo, the prime factors of \\(228\\) are \\(2, 2, 3, 19\\).\n\n## Step 18: Consider the negative sign\nSince the original number was negative, we need to consider the negative sign as a factor as well. However, in the context of prime factorization, we typically do not include the negative sign as a prime factor but rather indicate that the original number was negative.\n\n## Step 19: Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(-228\\) are \\(2, 2, 3, 19\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 2, 3, 19}$",

To do this, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we need to evaluate the expression inside the innermost parentheses first.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the expression inside the innermost parentheses\nThe expression inside the innermost parentheses is \\((-1)/(-3)\\). To divide two negative numbers, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by each other to make the signs positive, then divide.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression \\((-1)/(-3)\\)\n\\((-1)/(-3) = (-1) \\times (-3) / 1 = 3\\)\n\n## Step 4: Rewrite the original expression with the simplified expression\nNow we can rewrite the original expression as \\(27 - (-1)/3\\).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression \\(27 - (-1)/3\\)\nTo subtract a fraction from an integer, we need to convert the integer to a fraction with the same denominator. So we can rewrite the expression as \\(27 - 1/3\\).\n\n## Step 6: Convert 27 to a fraction with a denominator of 3\n\\(27 = 81/3\\)\n\n## Step 7: Rewrite the expression with the converted integer\nNow we can rewrite the expression as \\(81/3 - 1/3\\).\n\n## Step 8: Subtract the fractions\nTo subtract fractions, we need to have the same denominator. Since they already have the same denominator, we can subtract the numerators.\n\n## Step 9: Subtract the numerators\n\\(81/3 - 1/3 = (81 - 1)/3 = 80/3\\)\n\n## Step 10: Find the prime factors of 80\nTo find the prime factors of 80, we need to find the prime numbers that multiply together to give 80.\n\n## Step 11: Factor 80 into prime numbers\n\\(80 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 5\\)\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the prime factors\n\\(80 = 2^4 \\times 5\\)\n\n## Step 13: Find the prime factors of 3\nSince 3 is not a factor of 80, the prime factors of 80 are 2 and 5.\n\n## Step 14: Write the final answer\nThe prime factors of 80 are 2 and 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 5}$",

I'll address the parts that can be solved.\n\nGiven the incomplete nature of the problem, I'll focus on the parts that can be solved directly. Let's address the first part:\n\n### Step 1: Solve for x in the equation -4*x + 8 = -0\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x. However, the equation as given doesn't make sense because -0 is not a valid number.

However, I can provide the answer for the part that was solvable:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Check if 2 divides the number without leaving a remainder.  \n   \u2022 If yes, note 2 as a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until it no longer divides evenly.  \n   \u2022 If no, move on to the next prime number (3, then 5, 7, 11, and so on).  \n4. Continue checking divisibility by each prime, noting it as a factor and dividing out the prime repeatedly until it no longer divides.  \n5. Stop when your reduced number is 1.

What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers.

Suppose 2 - 18 = -r*f. Suppose 1 = -f*d + 49. List the prime factors of d.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Solve the equation -2*r + 0 = -8 for r\nTo find the value of r, we need to isolate r on one side of the equation. Since the equation is -2*r + 0 = -8, we can subtract 0 from both sides to get -2*r = -8. Then, we divide both sides by -2 to get r = 4.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the equation 2 - 18 = -r*f for f\nTo find the value of f, we need to isolate f on one side of the equation. Since the equation is 2 - 18 = -r*f, we can subtract 2 from both sides to get -16 = -r*f. Then, we divide both sides by -r to get f = 16/r.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the value of r into the equation f = 16/r\nSince we found that r = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation f = 16/r to get f = 16/4 = 4.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation 1 = -f*d + 49 for d\nTo find the value of d, we need to isolate d on one side of the equation. Since the equation is 1 = -f*d + 49, we can subtract 49 from both sides to get -48 = -f*d. Then, we divide both sides by -f to get d = 48/f.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the value of f into the equation d = 48/f\nSince we found that f = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation d = 48/f to get d = 48/4 = 12.\n\n## Step 6: Find the prime factors of d\nThe number 12 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 3.\n\n## Step 7: List the prime factors of d\nThe prime factors of d are 2, 2, and 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 2, 3}$",
