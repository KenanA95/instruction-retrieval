Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8.

Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c.

To solve for o, we need to isolate o on one side of the equation. First, subtract 2 from both sides:\n-6 - 2 = 2*o + 2 - 2\n-8 = 2*o\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n-8 / 2 = 2*o / 2\n-4 = o\n\n## Step 3: Find the value of z\nWe are given that 4*z + 2*o = q. Substitute the value of q and o into this equation:\n4*z + 2*(-4) = 28\n4*z - 8 = 28\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n4*z = 28 + 8\n4*z = 36\nDivide both sides by 4:\nz = 36 / 4\nz = 9\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of x\nWe are given that x(k) = k - 3. However, we don't have a specific value for k. Since we are asked to find the derivative of f(j) wrt j, we will assume that x is a function of j, and we will use x(j) instead of x(k).\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of g(p)\nWe are given that g(h) = 5*h - 12. However, we don't have a specific value for p. Since we are asked to find the derivative of f(j) wrt j, we will assume that g is a function of j, and we will use g(j) instead of g(p).\n\n## Step 6: Find the value of f(j)\nWe are given that f(p) = z*x(p) - 2*g(p). Substitute the values of z, x, and g into this equation:\nf(j) = 9*(j - 3) - 2*(5*j - 12)\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for f(j)\nExpand the equation:\nf(j) = 9*j - 27 - 10*j + 24\nCombine like terms:\nf(j) = -j - 3\n\n## Step 8: Find the derivative of f(j) wrt j\nThe derivative of f(j) wrt j is:\nf'(j) = d(-j - 3)/dj\nf'(j) = -1\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$",

Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  \n   d. Combine them: 3x\u00b2 + 4.\n\n11.

Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5.

After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c.

In this problem, we have a composite function a(t) = q*j(y) + 7*v(y), where j(y) = 8y - 6 and v(y) = 5 - 7y. We first need to find the expressions for j(y) and v(y) by substituting q = 6 into the equations. Then, we can find a(y) by substituting j(y) and v(y) into the equation. Finally, we can find the derivative of a(t) with respect to t by applying the appropriate differentiation rules.\n\nFinal Answer: -1",

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement, as the variable used for the function is s, but the derivative is asked with respect to t. Assuming the intention was to find the derivative of x(s) with respect to s, we will proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe derivative of \\( x''(s) \\) with respect to s is:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{ds}(-6s^3 + 1) \\]\n\n- The derivative of \\( -6s^3 \\) is \\( -6 \\times 3s^{3-1} = -18s^2 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( 1 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nThus, the derivative of \\( x''(s) \\) with respect to s is:\n\\[ -18s^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ -18s^2 \\]\n\nNote: Since the problem statement contains a mistake, the final answer is given in terms of s, not t. If the intention was to find the derivative of x(t) with respect to t, the correct variable should be used, and the answer would be in terms of t.",

Find the first derivative of n(g) wrt g.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the second derivative of the given function \\( f(t) = \\frac{5}{3}t^3 + \\frac{11}{2}t^2 - t \\).**\n\n2. **Differentiate \\( n(t) \\) with respect to \\( g \\) to find \\( n'(g) \\).**\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Find the second derivative of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(t) = \\frac{5}{3}t^3 + \\frac{11}{2}t^2 - t. \\]\n\n#### First Derivative \\( f'(t) \\):\n\nDifferentiate \\( f(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\):\n\\[ f'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{5}{3}t^3\\right) + \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{11}{2}t^2\\right) - \\frac{d}{dt}(t). \\]\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{5}{3}t^3 \\) is \\( 3 \\times \\frac{5}{3}t^{3-1} = 5t^2 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{11}{2}t^2 \\) is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{11}{2}t^{2-1} = 11t \\).\n- The derivative of \\( -t \\) is \\(-1\\).\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\\[ f'(t) = 5t^2 + 11t - 1. \\]\n\n#### Second Derivative \\( n(t) = f''(t) \\):\n\nDifferentiate \\( f'(t) \\) with respect to \\( t \\):\n\\[ f''(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(5t^2) + \\frac{d}{dt}(11t) - \\frac{d}{dt}(1). \\]\n\n- The derivative of \\( 5t^2 \\) is \\( 2 \\times 5t^{2-1} = 10t \\).\n- The derivative of \\( 11t \\) is \\( 11 \\).\n- The derivative of a constant \\( -1 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\\[ n(t) = f''(t) = 10t + 11. \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the first derivative of \\( n(g) \\) with respect to \\( g \\).\n\nSince \\( n(t) = 10t + 11 \\), and we are asked to find the derivative of \\( n(g) \\) with respect to \\( g \\), we assume \\( n(g) = 10g + 11 \\).\n\nDifferentiate \\( n(g) \\) with respect to \\( g \\):\n\\[ n'(g) = \\frac{d}{dg}(10g + 11). \\]\n\n- The derivative of \\( 10g \\) is \\( 10 \\).\n- The derivative of a constant \\( 11 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nThus, the first derivative of \\( n(g) \\) with respect to \\( g \\) is:\n\\[ n'(g) = 10. \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ n'(g) = 10. \\]\n\nAnswer: 10\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find the third derivative of 0*y**3 + 2*y**4 - 1 - 5 - y**2 - 8*y**3 - 4*y**3 wrt y.\n\nSolution:\nTo find the third derivative of the given expression with respect to \\( y \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 0 \\cdot y^3 + 2y^4 - 1 - 5 - y^2 - 8y^3 - 4y^3 \\]\n\nFirst, simplify the expression by combining like terms:\n\n1.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify each term in the function you want to differentiate. Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8.

However, there is no q in the original function. We assume that b(p) is a function of q, and we need to find the derivative of b(q) with respect to q.\n\n\nSince b(p) is a function of p, not q, we cannot directly find the derivative of b(q) with respect to q. The problem statement is incomplete or incorrect.\n\n\nHowever, if we assume that the intention was to find the derivative of the original function with respect to q, we can proceed as follows:\n\n\nThe original function is:\n\\[ f(q) = \\frac{4}{5}q^5 - \\frac{19}{2}q^2 - 1 \\]\n\nFirst, find the first derivative of f(q) with respect to q:\n\\[ b(q) = \\frac{d}{dq}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}q^5 - \\frac{19}{2}q^2 - 1\\right) \\]\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n\\[ b(q) = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot 5q^{5-1} - \\frac{19}{2} \\cdot 2q^{2-1} \\]\n\\[ b(q) = 4q^4 - 19q \\]\n\nNow, find the second derivative of f(q) with respect to q:\n\\[ b'(q) = \\frac{d}{dq}(4q^4 - 19q) \\]\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n\\[ b'(q) = 4 \\cdot 4q^{4-1} - 19 \\cdot 1 \\]\n\\[ b'(q) = 16q^3 - 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of the original function with respect to q is:\n\\[ b'(q) = 16q^3 - 19 \\]\n\nFinal Answer: 16*q**3 - 19",

Here's the solution:\n\nReasoning:\nTo find the first derivative of x(v) wrt v, we first need to find the first derivative of c(r) wrt r, and then find the first derivative of that result wrt v.\n\nGiven that c(f) is the first derivative of f**6/15 - f**2 - 7*f - 2, we can find c(r) by differentiating f**6/15 - f**2 - 7*f - 2 with respect to f.\n\nThe first derivative of f**6/15 - f**2 - 7*f - 2 is:\n\nc(f) = d/df (f**6/15 - f**2 - 7*f - 2)\n= (6/15)f**(6/15 - 1) - 2*f - 7\n\nNow, we need to find the first derivative of c(r) wrt r. Since c(f) is the first derivative of f**6/15 - f**2 - 7*f - 2, we can substitute f with r to get c(r):\n\nc(r) = (6/15)r**(6/15 - 1) - 2*r - 7\n\nNow, we need to find the first derivative of c(r) wrt r:\n\nx(v) = d/dr ((6/15)r**(6/15 - 1) - 2*r - 7)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nx(v) = (6/15)(6/15 - 1)r**(6/15 - 1 - 1) - 2\n= (6/15)(5/15)r**(6/15 - 2) - 2\n= (6/15)(5/15)r**(-3/15) - 2\n= (6/15)(1/3)r**(-3/15) - 2\n= (2/25)r**(-3/15) - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the first derivative of x(v) wrt v. Since x(v) is the first derivative of c(r), we can substitute r with v to get x(v):\n\nx(v) = (2/25)v**(-3/15) - 2\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nx(v) = (2/25)(-3/15)v**(-3/15 - 1)\n= (2/25)(-3/15)v**(-18/15)\n= (-6/375)v**(-18/15)\n= (-6/375)v**(-6/5)\n\nTherefore, the first derivative of x(v) wrt v is:\n\nx(v) = (-6/375)v**(-6/5)\n\nFinal Answer: (-6/375)*v**(-6/5)",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify each term in the function you want to differentiate. Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  \n   d. Combine them: 3x\u00b2 + 4.\n\n11.

Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1).

The derivative of \\( 8y^3 \\) is \\( 24y^2 \\).\n2. The derivative of \\(-36y^2\\) is \\(-72y\\).\n3.

Let g(o) = -o. Let k = 2 + 0. Suppose -k*t - 3 = t. Let v(w) = t*n(w) - 8*g(w). What is the second derivative of v(m) wrt m?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Define the function v(m) in terms of m\nFirst, we need to define the function v(m) in terms of m. We are given that n(b) = -2b^2 + 10b and g(o) = -o. We also know that k = 2 + 0, which means k = 2. We are given the equation -k*t - 3 = t, which we can solve for t to find t = -k - 3 = -2 - 3 = -5.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the expressions for n(b) and g(o) into v(m)\nNow, we substitute the expressions for n(b) and g(o) into v(m) = t*n(w) - 8*g(w). Since we are finding the derivative of v(m) with respect to m, we need to express v(m) in terms of m. We know that t = -5 and we can substitute this value into the expression for v(m).\n\n## Step 3: Substitute t = -5 into the expression for v(m)\nSubstituting t = -5 into the expression for v(m), we get v(m) = (-5)*n(m) - 8*g(m). We know that n(b) = -2b^2 + 10b, but we need to express this in terms of m. Since we are finding the derivative of v(m) with respect to m, we can assume that m = b.\n\n## Step 4: Express n(m) in terms of m\nNow, we express n(m) in terms of m. We have n(m) = -2m^2 + 10m.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute n(m) into the expression for v(m)\nSubstituting n(m) into the expression for v(m), we get v(m) = (-5)*(-2m^2 + 10m) - 8*(-m).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for v(m)\nSimplifying the expression for v(m), we get v(m) = 10m^2 - 50m + 8m = 10m^2 - 42m.\n\n## Step 7: Find the first derivative of v(m) with respect to m\nTo find the second derivative of v(m) with respect to m, we first need to find the first derivative of v(m) with respect to m. The first derivative of v(m) is v'(m) = 20m - 42.\n\n## Step 8: Find the second derivative of v(m) with respect to m\nTo find the second derivative of v(m) with respect to m, we differentiate the first derivative v'(m) with respect to m. The second derivative of v(m) is v''(m) = 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",

Since \\( d \\) is a variable, we cannot directly substitute it with \\( x \\). Instead, we should recognize that the original function \\( z(x) \\) is actually \\( o'''(d) \\), and we are looking for the derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\), which means we are looking for the derivative of \\( o'''(d) \\) with respect to \\( d \\), and then we should substitute \\( d \\) with \\( x \\) to get the derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\).\n\nSo, the correct derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ z'(x) = 3d^2 - 2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( d \\) with \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ z'(x) = 3x^2 - 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ z'(x) = 3x^2 - 2 \\]\n\nAnswer: 3*x**2 - 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find the first derivative of 2*x**3 + 3*x**2 - 2*x**2 + 5*x wrt x.\n\nSolution:\nTo find the first derivative of the given expression with respect to \\( x \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x^2 + 5x \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- Combine the \\( x^2 \\) terms: \n  \\[\n  3x^2 - 2x^2 = x^2\n  \\]\n\n- The \\( x \\) term remains as it is: \n  \\[\n  5x\n  \\]\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\\[ 2x^3 + x^2 + 5x \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nDifferentiate the simplified expression with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n1.

We are given that r = o(4), where o(v) = v + 1. So, r = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the equation -t - 2*t - 2*m + 2 = 0 for m\nWe are given the equation -t - 2*t - 2*m + 2 = 0. We can simplify this equation to -3*t - 2*m + 2 = 0.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation -r*t + 12 = -m for m\nWe are given the equation -r*t + 12 = -m. We can substitute the value of r = 5 into this equation to get -5*t + 12 = -m.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations -3*t - 2*m + 2 = 0 and -5*t + 12 = -m for t and m\nWe can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearrange the second equation to get m = 5*t - 12. Substitute this expression for m into the first equation: -3*t - 2*(5*t - 12) + 2 = 0. Simplify the equation to get -3*t - 10*t + 24 + 2 = 0. Combine like terms to get -13*t + 26 = 0. Subtract 26 from both sides to get -13*t = -26. Divide both sides by -13 to get t = 2.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of m\nNow that we have the value of t, we can find the value of m. Substitute t = 2 into the equation m = 5*t - 12 to get m = 5*2 - 12 = 10 - 12 = -2.\n\n## Step 6: Find the first derivative of t + 2*w**2 - w**5 - 2 wrt w\nTo find the first derivative, we'll apply the power rule for each term. The derivative of t is 1, the derivative of 2*w**2 is 4*w, the derivative of -w**5 is -5*w**4, and the derivative of -2 is 0. So, the first derivative is 1 + 4*w - 5*w**4.\n\n## Step 7: Find the second derivative of t + 2*w**2 - w**5 - 2 wrt w\nTo find the second derivative, we'll apply the power rule for each term. The derivative of 1 is 0, the derivative of 4*w is 4, the derivative of -5*w**4 is -20*w**3, and the derivative of 0 is 0. So, the second derivative is 4 - 20*w**3.\n\n## Step 8: Find the third derivative of t + 2*w**2 - w**5 - 2 wrt w\nTo find the third derivative, we'll apply the power rule for each term. The derivative of 4 is 0, the derivative of -20*w**3 is -60*w**2, and the derivative of 0 is 0. So, the third derivative is -60*w**2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-60*w**2}$",

Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  \n   d. Combine them: 3x\u00b2 + 4.\n\n11. Remember that understanding why these rules work (e.g., from the limit definition of the derivative) can help you avoid memorization mix-ups and build deeper problem-solving skills.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

However, I noticed that the problem statement contains a variable \"v\" which is not defined in the problem. I'm assuming it's a typo and the variable should be \"i\" instead.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\nReasoning:\nTo find the third derivative of the given expression with respect to \"i\", we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3i^v + 0i^2 - i^2 + 4i^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( 0i^2 = 0 \\) and \\( i^2 = -1 \\), the expression simplifies to:\n\\[ 3i^v - 1 + 4(-1) \\]\n\\[ 3i^v - 5 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nDifferentiate the simplified expression with respect to \"i\":\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{di}(3i^v - 5) \\]\n\nSince the derivative of a constant is 0, we only need to consider the term with \"i\":\n\\[ \\frac{d}{di}(3i^v) \\]\n\nTo differentiate \\( 3i^v \\), we need to know that the derivative of \\( i^v \\) with respect to \"i\" is \\( v \\cdot i^{v-1} \\). Therefore, the derivative of \\( 3i^v \\) is:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot v \\cdot i^{v-1} \\]\n\nSo, the first derivative is:\n\\[ 3v \\cdot i^{v-1} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nDifferentiate the first derivative with respect to \"i\":\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{di}(3v \\cdot i^{v-1}) \\]\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\\[ 3v \\cdot \\frac{d}{di}(i^{v-1}) + i^{v-1} \\cdot \\frac{d}{di}(3v) \\]\n\nThe derivative of \\( i^{v-1} \\) is \\( (v-1) \\cdot i^{v-2} \\) and the derivative of \"3v\" is 3. So, the second derivative is:\n\\[ 3v \\cdot (v-1) \\cdot i^{v-2} + 3i^{v-1} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate the second derivative with respect to \"i\":\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{di}(3v \\cdot (v-1) \\cdot i^{v-2} + 3i^{v-1}) \\]\n\nUsing the product rule again, we get:\n\\[ 3v \\cdot (v-1) \\cdot \\frac{d}{di}(i^{v-2}) + 3 \\cdot \\frac{d}{di}(i^{v-1}) + i^{v-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{di}(3v \\cdot (v-1)) \\]\n\nThe derivative of \\( i^{v-2} \\) is \\( (v-2) \\cdot i^{v-3} \\) and the derivative of \\( i^{v-1} \\) is \\( (v-1) \\cdot i^{v-2} \\). The derivative of \"3v \\cdot (v-1)\" is:\n\\[ 3v \\cdot (v-1) + 3(v-1) \\]\n\nSo, the third derivative is:\n\\[ 3v \\cdot (v-1) \\cdot (v-2) \\cdot i^{v-3} + 3(v-1) \\cdot (v-1) \\cdot i^{v-2} + i^{v-2} \\cdot (3v \\cdot (v-1) + 3(v-1)) \\]\n\nSince the original problem statement does not provide a specific value for \"v\", the final answer cannot be simplified further.\n\nHowever, if we assume that \"v\" is a constant, we can simplify the third derivative as follows:\n\n\\[ 3v \\cdot (v-1) \\cdot (v-2) \\cdot i^{v-3} + 3(v-1)^2 \\cdot i^{v-2} + i^{v-2} \\cdot (3v \\cdot (v-1) + 3(v-1)) \\]\n\nThis is the third derivative of the given expression with respect to \"i\".\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer cannot be simplified further without knowing the value of \"v\".",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify each term in the function you want to differentiate. Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify each term in the function you want to differentiate. Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  \n   d. Combine them: 3x\u00b2 + 4.\n\n11. Remember that understanding why these rules work (e.g., from the limit definition of the derivative) can help you avoid memorization mix-ups and build deeper problem-solving skills.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Identify each term in the function you want to differentiate. Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  \n   d. Combine them: 3x\u00b2 + 4.\n\n11. Remember that understanding why these rules work (e.g., from the limit definition of the derivative) can help you avoid memorization mix-ups and build deeper problem-solving skills.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

Here's the solution:\n\nReasoning:\nTo find the third derivative of p(m) with respect to m, we first need to find the second derivative of p(r) with respect to r, and then find the derivative of that result with respect to m.\n\nGiven that p(r) is the second derivative of t(r), we need to find the second derivative of t(r) first.\n\nThe function t(r) is the second derivative of g**10/5040 - g**6/180 - g**3 - 2*g.\n\nFirst, we need to find the first derivative of t(r) with respect to r.\n\nThe first derivative of g**10/5040 is (10/5040)*g**(10-1) = (1/504)g^9.\nThe first derivative of g**6/180 is (6/180)*g**(6-1) = (1/30)g^5.\nThe first derivative of g**3 is 3*g**(3-1) = 3g^2.\nThe first derivative of -2*g is -2.\n\nSo, the first derivative of t(r) is:\n(1/504)g^9 + (1/30)g^5 + 3g^2 - 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative of t(r) with respect to r.\n\nThe second derivative of (1/504)g^9 is (9/504)g**(9-1) = (1/56)g^8.\nThe second derivative of (1/30)g^5 is (5/30)*g**(5-1) = (1/6)g^4.\nThe second derivative of 3g^2 is 6g.\nThe second derivative of -2 is 0.\n\nSo, the second derivative of t(r) is:\n(1/56)g^8 + (1/6)g^4 + 6g.\n\nNow, we have p(r) = (1/56)g^8 + (1/6)g^4 + 6g.\n\nTo find the third derivative of p(m) with respect to m, we need to find the second derivative of p(r) with respect to r, and then find the derivative of that result with respect to m.\n\nThe second derivative of p(r) with respect to r is:\n(8/56)g**(8-1) = (1/7)g^7 + (4/6)g**(4-1) = (2/21)g^7 + (2/3)g^3.\nThe derivative of 6g is 6.\n\nSo, the second derivative of p(r) is:\n(1/7)g^7 + (2/3)g^3 + 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of this result with respect to m.\n\nSince p(r) is a function of g, and we are finding the derivative with respect to m, we need to substitute g with m.\n\nThe derivative of (1/7)g^7 with respect to m is (7/7)g**(7-1) = g^6.\nThe derivative of (2/3)g^3 with respect to m is 0.\nThe derivative of 6 with respect to m is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of p(m) with respect to m is:\ng^6.\n\nTherefore, the third derivative of p(m) with respect to m is:\ng^6.\n\nFinal Answer: g^6",

If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.\n\n9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.\n\n10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x\u00b3 + 4x - 7:\n   a. Differentiate x\u00b3: 3x\u00b2.  \n   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  \n   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  \n   d. Combine them: 3x\u00b2 + 4.\n\n11. Remember that understanding why these rules work (e.g., from the limit definition of the derivative) can help you avoid memorization mix-ups and build deeper problem-solving skills.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

Recognize that a \u201cterm\u201d is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.\n\n2. Recall the power rule: if you have x\u207f, its derivative is n \u00b7 x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.\n\n3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.\n\n4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.\n\n5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) \u00b7 v(x)] = u'(x) \u00b7 v(x) + u(x) \u00b7 v'(x).\n   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.\n\n6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:\n   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) \u00b7 u'(x) - u(x) \u00b7 v'(x)] / [v(x)]\u00b2.\n   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.\n\n7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:\n   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x).\n   Identify the \u201cinner\u201d function and the \u201couter\u201d function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.\n\n8.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(a) be the second derivative of a**7/70 - 3*a**6/40 + a**5/10 + 9*a**2/2 - 4*a.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Solve 37/8*i**3 - 7/8*i**4 - 1 - 33/4*i**2 + 11/2*i = 0 for i.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nTo solve the given equation \\(37/8*i^3 - 7/8*i^4 - 1 - 33/4*i^2 + 11/2*i = 0\\), first simplify the equation by combining like terms and expressing all terms with the same power of \\(i\\).

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v(j) be the third derivative of -j**8/588 - 11*j**7/1470 - 3*j**6/280 - j**5/420 + j**4/168 - 6*j**2.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials.

Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11. Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let d(c) be the third derivative of -c**8/10080 + c**7/2016 - c**6/1440 + c**5/30 - 7*c**2.

This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11. Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let h(x) be the second derivative of 7/24*x**4 - 4*x + 0*x**2 + 0 - 1/4*x**3 + 1/60*x**6 - 1/8*x**5.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let r(g) be the second derivative of 16*g**7/147 + 8*g**6/15 + 73*g**5/70 + 43*g**4/42 + 11*g**3/21 + g**2/7 + 4*g.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = 3*m + 207 - 222.

However, I'll attempt to provide a solution based on the given information.\n\n## Step 1: Simplify the equation\nThe given equation is 0 = 3*m + 207 - 222. To simplify, let's first combine the constants on the right side:\n\n0 = 3*m - 15\n\n## Step 2: Solve for m\nTo solve for m, we need to isolate m on one side of the equation. Add 15 to both sides:\n\n15 = 3*m\n\n## Step 3: Divide by 3\nDivide both sides by 3 to solve for m:\n\nm = 15 / 3\n\nm = 5\n\n## Step 4: Substitute m into the original equation\nSubstitute m = 5 into the original equation:\n\n0 = 104/3*i**2 - 434/3*i**4 + 92/3*i**3 - 196*i**m + 16/3*i\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation\nSince m = 5, the term -196*i**m becomes -196*i**5. The equation becomes:\n\n0 = 104/3*i**2 - 434/3*i**4 + 92/3*i**3 - 196*i**5 + 16/3*i\n\n## Step 6: Factor out the greatest common factor\nNotice that the coefficients of the terms have a common factor of 1/3. Factor it out:\n\n0 = (1/3)*(104*i**2 - 434*i**4 + 92*i**3 - 196*i**5 + 16*i)\n\n## Step 7: Solve for i\nTo solve for i, we need to find the roots of the equation. However, the equation is a fifth-degree polynomial, and solving it analytically is challenging. We can try to find the rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem or use numerical methods.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the exact roots, we can conclude that the solution involves finding the roots of the polynomial:\n\n104*i**2 - 434*i**4 + 92*i**3 - 196*i**5 + 16*i = 0\n\nThis requires numerical methods or approximation techniques.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor -32 - 224*l**2 + 163*l + 13*l + 30*l**3 - 56*l**2 + 70*l**3.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Combine like terms\nFirst, let's simplify the given expression by combining like terms. The expression is \\(-32 - 224l^2 + 163l + 13l + 30l^3 - 56l^2 + 70l^3\\). Combining like terms, we get \\(-32 - 280l^2 + 186l + 100l^3\\).\n\n## Step 2: Factor out the greatest common factor\nWe notice that all terms have a common factor of \\(l\\). Factoring out \\(l\\), we get \\(l(-32 - 280l^2 + 186l + 100l^2)\\).\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses\nNow, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses. Combining like terms, we get \\(l(-32 - 280l^2 + 186l + 100l^2)\\) which simplifies to \\(l(-32 - 180l^2 + 186l)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Factor the quadratic expression\nWe can factor the quadratic expression \\(-180l^2 + 186l\\) by finding two numbers that multiply to \\(-180 \\times 186\\) and add to \\(186\\). These numbers are \\(90\\) and \\(-2\\), so we can factor the expression as \\(-90l(2l - 2)\\).\n\n## Step 5: Factor out the greatest common factor again\nNow, we can factor out the greatest common factor of \\(-90l\\), which is \\(-90l\\). Factoring out \\(-90l\\), we get \\(-90l(2l - 2)\\).\n\n## Step 6: Factor the expression inside the parentheses\nThe expression inside the parentheses is \\(2l - 2\\), which can be factored as \\(2(l - 1)\\).\n\n## Step 7: Write the final factored form\nThe final factored form of the expression is \\(-90l(2l - 2)(l - 1)\\).\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression further by factoring out a \\(2\\) from the first two factors, resulting in \\(-90l \\times 2(l - 1)(l - 1)\\) which simplifies to \\(-180l(l - 1)^2\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-180l(l - 1)^2}$",

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z = -11 - -56/5.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(w) be the second derivative of -w**7/840 + w**6/240 + w**5/20 - w**4/6 - w.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let x(k) be the first derivative of 0*k - 1 + 4*k**3 - 9*k**2 - 1/2*k**4.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = -6*t + 3*t - 3*i + 9, 0 = -2*t + 3*i + 1.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11. Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z(j) be the third derivative of 1/18*j**4 - 3*j**2 - 1/3*j**3 + 0*j - 1/270*j**5 + 0.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let a = -4 - -6.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let t(a) be the third derivative of -1/45*a**4 + 0*a**3 - 5*a**2 + 8/225*a**5 + 0 - 7/900*a**6 + 0*a.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3.

Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(c) be the third derivative of -c**8/84 + c**6/30 + 5*c**2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let c(w) be the first derivative of -w**2 + 1 + 0*w**3 + 0*w**4 + 1/240*w**5 + 0*w.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor -3*a**4 + 2*a + 0*a**2 - 2*a**5 - a**4 - 8*a**2 + 12*a**2.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Combine like terms\nFirst, we need to combine like terms in the given polynomial: \\(-3a^4 + 2a - 2a^5 - a^4 - 8a^2 + 12a^2\\).\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression\nCombine the coefficients of like terms:\n\\(-3a^4 - a^4 - 2a^5 - 8a^2 + 12a^2 + 2a\\).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\(-4a^5 - 3a^4 + 4a^2 + 2a\\).\n\n## Step 3: Factor out the greatest common factor\nNotice that there is no common factor that can be factored out from all terms.\n\n## Step 4: Factor by grouping\nWe can try to factor by grouping, but there's no obvious way to do so in this case.\n\n## Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nThe constant term is 0, and the leading coefficient is -4.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor 32/5*r + 6/5*r**2 + 2.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from the given expression.\nThe GCF of 32/5, 6/5, and 2 is 2/5.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

However, we can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem or use numerical methods.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of p/q, is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nThe constant term is 0, and the leading coefficient is 1. This means that any rational root must be 0.\n\n## Step 9: Check for Rational Roots\nSince the constant term is 0, we can immediately conclude that there is a root at s = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Factor the Polynomial\nSince s = 0 is a root, we can factor out an s from the polynomial:\n\n\\[\na(s) = s(s^3 + \\frac{16s^2}{3} + 8s + 5) = 0\n\\]\n\n## Step 11: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nWe need to solve the cubic polynomial:\n\n\\[\ns^3 + \\frac{16s^2}{3} + 8s + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis equation does not have an obvious factorization, and solving it analytically can be challenging. We can try numerical methods or approximation techniques.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let 0*h**3 + 0 + 1/2*h**4 + 0*h - 1/2*h**2 = 0.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(d) be the first derivative of 2/5*d**2 - 1/15*d**3 + 3 - 1/30*d**4 - 3*d.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 2*w + 1 = 2*i - i, 2 = -5*w + 2*i.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose -t + 17 = -3.

However, I can guide you through the steps for the first problem you provided.\n\n## Step 1: Solve the equation -t + 17 = -3 for t\nTo solve for t, we need to isolate t on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding t to both sides of the equation and then subtracting 17 from both sides.\n\n## Step 2: Add t to both sides of the equation\n-t + t + 17 = -3 + t\nThis simplifies to 17 = t - 3.\n\n## Step 3: Add 3 to both sides of the equation\n17 + 3 = t - 3 + 3\nThis simplifies to 20 = t.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute t into the second equation -5*n + t = 0\nSubstitute t = 20 into the equation -5*n + t = 0.\n-5*n + 20 = 0\n\n## Step 5: Solve for n\nSubtract 20 from both sides of the equation.\n-5*n = -20\n\n## Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by -5\n(-5*n)/(-5) = -20/(-5)\nThis simplifies to n = 4.\n\n## Step 7: Factor the polynomial 2/7*i**2 + 0*i + f + 2/7*i**3\nTo factor the polynomial, we need to find a common factor.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(i) = i - 2.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let g(o) = o**3 + 5*o**2 + 2*o + 1.

We can factor out -2/7*i\u00b2:\n\n-2/7*i\u00b2*(4*i + 3)\n\n### Step 4: Factor the Quadratic Expression\n\nThe quadratic expression 4*i + 3 does not factor easily. However, we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots:\n\ni = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\ni = (-0 \u00b1 \u221a(0\u00b2 - 4*4*3)) / (2*4)\ni = (-0 \u00b1 \u221a(-48)) / 8\ni = (-0 \u00b1 4\u221a(-3)) / 8\ni = (-0 \u00b1 4i\u221a3) / 8\ni = \u00b1 i\u221a3 / 2\n\n### Step 5: Write the Final Factorization\n\nThe final factorization is:\n\n-2/7*i\u00b2*(4*i + 3) = -2/7*i\u00b2*(2i\u221a3 + 3)\n\nHowever, since i\u00b2 = -1, we can simplify further:\n\n-2/7*(-1)*(2i\u221a3 + 3) = 2/7*(2i\u221a3 + 3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final answer is not a single number but an expression.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let c(b) be the first derivative of -2*b**3/51 + 2*b**2/17 + 12.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Then convert each fraction to have this common denominator: z = (36*2)/(27*2) - (4*9)/(6*9) = 72/54 - 36/54 = (72 - 36)/54 = 36/54 = 2/3.\n\n## Step 2: Differentiate the function n(d) to find n'(d)\nTo find the second derivative n(d), we first need to find the first derivative n'(d). The function is n(d) = 2*d^2 - 2*d + 1/12*d^4 + z*d^3 + 0. Differentiating each term with respect to d gives: n'(d) = 4d - 2 + 1/3*d^3 + 3*z*d^2.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the value of z into the expression for n'(d)\nNow, substitute the value of z = 2/3 into the expression for n'(d): n'(d) = 4d - 2 + 1/3*d^3 + 3*(2/3)*d^2 = 4d - 2 + 1/3*d^3 + 2*d^2.\n\n## Step 4: Differentiate n'(d) to find n''(d)\nTo find the second derivative n''(d), differentiate n'(d) with respect to d: n''(d) = 4 + 1/3*3*d^2 + 2*2*d = 4 + d^2 + 4d.\n\n## Step 5: Set n''(d) equal to zero and solve for d\nNow, set n''(d) equal to zero and solve for d: 4 + d^2 + 4d = 0. Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation: d^2 + 4d + 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation\nTo solve the quadratic equation d^2 + 4d + 4 = 0, use the quadratic formula: d = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = 4, and c = 4.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the discriminant\nCalculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4*1*4 = 16 - 16 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for d\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root. Solve for d: d = (-b) / 2a = -4 / (2*1) = -2.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the value of d into the expression for z\nSubstitute the value of d = -2 into the expression for z: z = 36/27 - (-4)/(-6) = 36/27 - 4/6 = (36 - 12)/27 = 24/27 = 8/9.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the solution\nVerify that the solution satisfies the original equation n(u) = 0.

The correct solution is d = -2 is not a solution to the equation n(u) = 0.\n\n## Step 12: Re-solve the quadratic equation\nRe-solve the quadratic equation d^2 + 4d + 4 = 0. Factor the quadratic equation: (d + 2)^2 = 0.\n\n## Step 13: Solve for d\nSolve for d: d + 2 = 0 --> d = -2.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the solution\nVerify that the solution satisfies the original equation n(u) = 0. Substitute d = -2 into the expression for n'(d): n'(-2) = 4*(-2) - 2 + 1/3*(-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 = -8 - 2 - 8/3 + 12 = -18/3 - 8/3 + 36/3 = 10/3.

Factor the quadratic equation: (d + 2)^2 = 0.\n\n## Step 17: Solve for d again\nSolve for d: d + 2 = 0 --> d = -2.\n\n## Step 18: Verify the solution again\nVerify that the solution satisfies the original equation n(u) = 0. Substitute d = -2 into the expression for n'(d): n'(-2) = 4*(-2) - 2 + 1/3*(-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 = -8 - 2 - 8/3 + 12 = -18/3 - 8/3 + 36/3 = 10/3.

Substitute d = -2 into the expression for n'(d): n'(-2) = 4*(-2) - 2 + 1/3*(-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 = -8 - 2 - 8/3 + 12 = -18/3 - 8/3 + 36/3 = 10/3.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u(p) = -3 + 0*p + p**3 - 2*p**2 - p - p.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(m) be the first derivative of -2/5*m**2 - 2/15*m**3 - 2/5*m + 7.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Finally, divide both sides by -2 to get x = 2*s - 5.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the third equation for h\nTo solve the equation h**3 + h + 4*h**2 - 2*h**2 + 0*h**s = 0 for h, we need to simplify the equation. First, combine like terms to get h**3 + 2*h**2 + h = 0. Then, factor out h to get h*(h**2 + 2*h + 1) = 0. Finally, factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses to get h*(h + 1)**2 = 0.\n\n## Step 4: Find the solutions for h\nTo find the solutions for h, we need to set each factor equal to 0 and solve for h. First, set h = 0 and solve for h to get h = 0. Then, set (h + 1)**2 = 0 and solve for h to get h + 1 = 0, which implies h = -1.\n\n## Step 5: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0, -1}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let w(n) = -2*n - 2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

What is z?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Rearrange the equation to standard form\nThe equation given is 12 + 4/3*z**2 + 8*z = 0. To set it to standard form, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation and ensure all terms are on one side. The equation becomes 4/3*z**2 + 8*z + 12 = 0.\n\n## Step 2: Multiply the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction\nTo simplify the equation and make it easier to work with, we multiply every term by 3 to get rid of the fraction. This gives us 4*z**2 + 24*z + 36 = 0.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the coefficients for the quadratic formula\nIn the quadratic equation of the form ax**2 + bx + c = 0, we have a = 4, b = 24, and c = 36.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the quadratic formula\nThe quadratic formula is z = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b**2 - 4ac)) / (2a). Plugging in the values of a, b, and c, we get z = (-24 \u00b1 \u221a(24**2 - 4*4*36)) / (2*4).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression under the square root\nCalculate the discriminant: 24**2 - 4*4*36 = 576 - 576 = 0.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for z\nSince the discriminant is 0, the equation has one real root. The formula simplifies to z = (-24 \u00b1 \u221a0) / 8.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the root\nz = (-24 \u00b1 0) / 8 = -24 / 8 = -3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3}$",

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10.

The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Solve 102*q**5 -

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11. Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11. Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = 3*o - d - 2, -2*o + 0*d - d + 3 = 0.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z = -89 + 89.

Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3.

After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let x(y) be the first derivative of y**6/9 + 4*y**5/15 - y**4/6 - 4*y**3/9 - 46.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u be 3/(-18)*(-16)/20.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k be (((-72)/20)/2)/((-5)/25).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m be (-1 + (-1)/(-3))*9. Let n be m/3 + (1 - -4). Solve -1/2*s**2 + 0 + 1/4*s**n + 1/4*s = 0.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Evaluate the expression for m\nFirst, we need to evaluate the expression for m: (-1 + (-1)/(-3))*9. To do this, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression for m\nWe start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses: (-1 + (-1)/(-3)). The two negative signs make the second term positive, so we have (-1 + 1/3).\n\n## Step 3: Continue simplifying the expression for m\nNow we simplify the expression further: (-1 + 1/3) = (-3/3 + 1/3) = (-2/3).\n\n## Step 4: Multiply the simplified expression by 9\nNow we multiply the simplified expression by 9: (-2/3)*9 = -6.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the expression for n\nNext, we need to evaluate the expression for n: m/3 + (1 - -4). We already know that m = -6.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for n\nNow we simplify the expression for n: (-6)/3 + (1 + 4) = -2 + 5 = 3.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the values of m and n into the equation\nNow we substitute the values of m and n into the equation: -1/2*s**2 + 1/4*s**n + 1/4*s = 0. This becomes -1/2*s**2 + 1/4*s**3 + 1/4*s = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Factor out the common term 1/4\nWe can factor out the common term 1/4: 1/4*(-2*s**2 + s**3 + s) = 0.\n\n## Step 9: Factor out the common term s\nWe can factor out the common term s: 1/4*s*(-2*s + s**2 + 1) = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for s\nNow we can solve for s: 1/4*s*(-2*s + s**2 + 1) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions: s = 0 or -2*s + s**2 + 1 = 0.\n\n## Step 11: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation -2*s + s**2 + 1 = 0 using the quadratic formula: s = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b**2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -2, and c = 1.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant is b**2 - 4ac = (-2)**2 - 4(1)(1) = 4 - 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 13: Solve for s\nSince the discriminant is 0, there is only one solution: s = -b / 2a = -(-2) / (2*1) = 1.\n\n## Step 14: Write the final solutions\nThe final solutions are s = 0 and s = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4.

Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Make sure the polynomial is written in standard form (all terms on one side set equal to 0, ordered by descending exponent). For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10. Remember the goal is to understand why each step works, rather than just memorizing formulas. Ask yourself why setting each factor to zero finds the solutions or why we use the quadratic formula when factoring isn\u2019t straightforward. This deeper understanding helps in solving more challenging polynomials.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v = 6 + -2.

For instance, if you have a problem like x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0, confirm it\u2019s already set to zero and in the correct order.\n\n2. Look for a Greatest Common Factor (GCF). If there is any factor common to all terms, factor it out first. For example, if you have 2x\u00b3 + 4x\u00b2, you can factor out 2x\u00b2, simplifying it to 2x\u00b2(x + 2).\n\n3. Attempt to factor the polynomial. For quadratics (degree 2), see if it can be factored into two binomials. Example: x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).  \n   \u2013 If factoring isn\u2019t obvious or possible, consider the quadratic formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x\u00b2, x, and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. For higher-degree polynomials, try methods such as:  \n   \u2013 Grouping: Split the middle terms into groups that share common factors.  \n   \u2013 Polynomial division or synthetic division if you suspect a particular root or if you use the Rational Root Theorem (possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient).\n\n5. Check for sign errors carefully. Mistakes with negative signs often lead to wrong factors or incorrect solutions. Write down each step clearly and double-check arithmetic.\n\n6. After factoring or using a formula, set each factor equal to 0 to find the roots. For instance, if (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0, the solutions are x = 2 or x = -3.\n\n7. Recognize that some polynomials may have complex roots if the discriminant (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is negative (in the case of quadratics) or if factoring indicates complex solutions. Include these when asked to find all roots.\n\n8. Always verify solutions by plugging them back into the original polynomial equation. This helps catch mistakes from earlier steps.\n\n9. If you have trouble factoring, consider the possibility of prime polynomials (polynomials that cannot be factored over the real numbers) and then use the appropriate formula or numerical methods.\n\n10.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v be 2/(-30)*(-2)/20.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5.

I will solve the first equation to find the value of b, and then use that value to find the prime factors of i.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n## Step 1: Solve the equation -b + 4 = -3 for b\n\nTo solve for b, we need to isolate b on one side of the equation. Let's add b to both sides:\n\n\\[\n-b + b + 4 = -3 + b\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4 = b - 3\n\\]\n\nNow, add 3 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n4 + 3 = b\n\\]\n\nSo, b = 7.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the value of b into the equation -1 = -4*p + b\n\nNow that we know b = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[\n-1 = -4*p + 7\n\\]\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-1 - 7 = -4*p\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-8 = -4*p\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-8}{-4} = p\n\\]\n\nSo, p = 2.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the value of p into the equation 5*p + 10 = 5*i\n\nNow that we know p = 2, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[\n5*2 + 10 = 5*i\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n10 + 10 = 5*i\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n20 = 5*i\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{5} = i\n\\]\n\nSo, i = 4.\n\n## Step 4: Find the prime factors of i\n\nThe number 4 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n4 = 2 \\times 2\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 are prime numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe prime factors of i are 2 and 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 2}$",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since 2 is a prime number, the only prime factor of \\( u \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of \\( u \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f be -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since 2 is a prime number, the only prime factor of \\( u \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of \\( u \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f be -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process.

Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7.

Since x is a fraction, we need to find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is -1, which is not a prime number. The denominator is 7, which is a prime number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since 2 is a prime number, the only prime factor of \\( u \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of \\( u \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f be -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  \n3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  \n4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, \u2026) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  \n5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number\u2019s prime factors.  \n\nTips and Pitfalls:  \n\u2022 A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  \n\u2022 If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  \n\u2022 Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  \n\u2022 Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  \n\nExample (not from the provided data):  \n\u2022 Suppose you want to factor 84.  \n\u2022 Start with 2: 84 \u00f7 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 \u00f7 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 \u00f7 2 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 Next check 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so move on.  \n\u2022 The next prime is 5, which doesn\u2019t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  \n\u2022 The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

List the prime factors of v.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Solve the first equation for v\nGiven the equation 4*a = -v + 182, we can solve for v by rearranging the equation to isolate v. First, we'll subtract 182 from both sides to get -v = 4*a - 182. Then, we'll multiply both sides by -1 to solve for v, resulting in v = 182 - 4*a.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the second equation for v\nGiven the equation 4*v + 3*a = v + 546, we can solve for v by rearranging the equation to isolate v. First, we'll subtract 3*a from both sides to get 4*v = v + 546 - 3*a. Then, we'll subtract v from both sides to get 3*v = 546 - 3*a. Finally, we'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for v, resulting in v = (546 - 3*a) / 3.\n\n## Step 3: Equate the two expressions for v\nSince both equations equal v, we can set the two expressions for v equal to each other: 182 - 4*a = (546 - 3*a) / 3.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for a\nTo solve for a, we'll first multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 546 - 12*a = 546 - 3*a. Then, we'll subtract 546 from both sides to get -12*a = -3*a. Next, we'll add 3*a to both sides to get -9*a = 0. Finally, we'll divide both sides by -9 to solve for a, resulting in a = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of v\nNow that we know a = 0, we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to solve for v. We'll use the first equation: v = 182 - 4*a. Substituting a = 0, we get v = 182 - 4*0 = 182.\n\n## Step 6: Find the prime factors of v\nThe number 182 can be factored into:\n\n182 = 2 * 91\n\nFurther factoring 91, we get:\n\n91 = 7 * 13\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of v are 2, 7, and 13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 7, 13}$",
