Find the second derivative of 7*d**3 + 7*d**z - 2*d - 7*d**3 wrt d.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Simplify the given equation\nThe given equation is -12 = -3*z - 0*z. Since 0*z is 0, we can simplify the equation to -12 = -3*z.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for z\nTo solve for z, we need to isolate z on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 3*z to both sides of the equation, which results in -12 + 3*z = 0. Then, we can add 12 to both sides to get 3*z = 12. Finally, we can divide both sides by 3 to get z = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute z into the original expression\nNow that we know z = 4, we can substitute this value into the original expression 7*d**3 + 7*d**z - 2*d - 7*d**3.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nSince d**z is equivalent to d**4 (because z = 4), we can rewrite the expression as 7*d**3 + 7*d**4 - 2*d - 7*d**3.\n\n## Step 5: Combine like terms\nWe can combine the d**3 terms to get 0*d**3 + 7*d**4 - 2*d. This simplifies to 7*d**4 - 2*d.\n\n## Step 6: Find the first derivative\nTo find the first derivative, we'll apply the power rule of differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1). In this case, we have 7*d**4 - 2*d, so the first derivative is 28*d**3 - 2.\n\n## Step 7: Find the second derivative\nTo find the second derivative, we'll apply the power rule again. The derivative of 28*d**3 is 84*d**2, and the derivative of -2 is 0. So, the second derivative is 84*d**2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84*d**2}$",

Let z(j) be the third derivative of o(j). What is the derivative of z(x) wrt x?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the First Derivative of o(d)\n\nThe given function is:\n\\[ o(d) = \\frac{d^6}{120} - \\frac{d^4}{12} - d^3 + 5 \\]\n\nDifferentiate \\( o(d) \\) with respect to \\( d \\):\n\n1. The derivative of \\( \\frac{d^6}{120} \\) is \\( \\frac{6d^5}{120} = \\frac{d^5}{20} \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{d^4}{12} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4d^3}{12} = -\\frac{d^3}{3} \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( -d^3 \\) is \\( -3d^2 \\).\n4. The derivative of \\( 5 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\\[ o'(d) = \\frac{d^5}{20} - \\frac{d^3}{3} - 3d^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the Second Derivative of o(d)\n\nDifferentiate the first derivative with respect to \\( d \\):\n\n1. The derivative of \\( \\frac{d^5}{20} \\) is \\( \\frac{5d^4}{20} = \\frac{d^4}{4} \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{d^3}{3} \\) is \\( -\\frac{3d^2}{3} = -d^2 \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( -3d^2 \\) is \\( -6d \\).\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\\[ o''(d) = \\frac{d^4}{4} - d^2 - 6d \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Third Derivative of o(d)\n\nDifferentiate the second derivative with respect to \\( d \\):\n\n1. The derivative of \\( \\frac{d^4}{4} \\) is \\( d^3 \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -d^2 \\) is \\( -2d \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( -6d \\) is \\( -6 \\).\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\\[ o'''(d) = d^3 - 2d - 6 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Derivative of z(x) wrt x\n\nSince \\( z(j) = o'''(d) \\), we substitute \\( j \\) with \\( x \\) to get \\( z(x) = o'''(d) \\):\n\n\\[ z(x) = d^3 - 2d - 6 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n1. The derivative of \\( d^3 \\) is \\( 3d^2 \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -2d \\) is \\( -2 \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( -6 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nThus, the derivative of \\( z(x) \\) is:\n\\[ z'(x) = 3d^2 - 2 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to express the derivative in terms of \\( x \\), not \\( d \\). Since \\( d \\) is a variable, we cannot directly substitute it with \\( x \\). Instead, we should recognize that the original function \\( z(x) \\) is actually a function of \\( d \\), and we are finding its derivative with respect to \\( x \\), not \\( d \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(a) be the second derivative of a**7/70 - 3*a**6/40 + a**5/10 + 9*a**2/2 - 4*a.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(i) be the third derivative of -i**5/24 + 5*i**4/48 + 5*i**3/6 + 9*i**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Solve 37/8*i**3 -

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

If factoring by inspection fails, use the quadratic formula:  \n  x = (\u2212b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 \u2212 4ac)) / (2a)  \n\u2022 For cubic or higher-degree polynomials:  \n  1.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v(j) be the third derivative of -j**8/588 - 11*j**7/1470 - 3*j**6/280 - j**5/420 + j**4/168 - 6*j**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let d(c) be the third derivative of -c**8/10080 + c**7/2016 - c**6/1440 + c**5/30 - 7*c**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let h(x) be the second derivative of 7/24*x**4 - 4*x + 0*x**2 + 0 - 1/4*x**3 + 1/60*x**6 - 1/8*x**5.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let r(g) be the second derivative of 16*g**7/147 + 8*g**6/15 + 73*g**5/70 + 43*g**4/42 + 11*g**3/21 + g**2/7 + 4*g.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 4*a = -8, 0 = -3*n - a - 2 + 6.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = 3*m + 207 - 222.

The equation provided does not follow the standard format of a polynomial equation, and the variable \"i\" is used in a way that suggests it might be a complex number, but the problem statement does not specify what \"i\" represents.\n\nHowever, assuming \"i\" is a variable and the equation is meant to be solved as a polynomial equation, I'll provide a general approach to solving it.\n\n## Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms and rearranging it to standard form:\n\n\\[ 104/3*i^2 - 434/3*i^4 + 92/3*i^3 - 196*i^m + 16/3*i = 207 - 222 \\]\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), \\( i^3 = -i \\), and \\( i^4 = 1 \\), we can simplify the equation:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{104}{3} - \\frac{434}{3} + \\frac{92}{3}i - 196*i^m + \\frac{16}{3}i = 207 - 222 \\]\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Further\nCombine like terms and simplify the constants:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{104}{3} - \\frac{434}{3} + \\frac{92}{3}i - 196*i^m + \\frac{16}{3}i = -15 \\]\n\n\\[ -\\frac{538}{3} + \\frac{92}{3}i - 196*i^m + \\frac{16}{3}i = -15 \\]\n\n## Step 3: Isolate the Variable\nTo solve for \"i\", we need to isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation. However, without knowing the value of \"m\", we cannot simplify further.\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion\nSince the problem statement is incomplete or incorrectly formatted, and the variable \"m\" is not defined, we cannot provide a numerical solution. The equation as presented does not follow standard polynomial equation format, and without further clarification or correction, we cannot proceed with a numerical solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor -32 -

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let h(a) be the third derivative of a**8/168 + a**7/35 - 2*a**5/15 + 11*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(w) be the second derivative of -w**7/840 + w**6/240 + w**5/20 - w**4/6 - w.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose -5*d - 7 + 22 = 0.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: What is l in -10/3*l + 14/3*l**2 - 4/3 = 0?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Identify the polynomial and ensure it is set equal to zero\nThe given equation is already set equal to zero: \\(-\\frac{10}{3}l + \\frac{14}{3}l^2 - \\frac{4}{3} = 0\\).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the degree of the polynomial\nThe degree of the polynomial is 2, as the highest power of \\(l\\) is 2.\n\n## Step 3: Factor out any common factor (if present)\nThere is no common factor to factor out.\n\n## Step 4: Attempt appropriate factoring techniques or formulas\nSince the degree is 2, we can use the quadratic formula: \\(l = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Solve for the roots using the quadratic formula\nIdentify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n- \\(a = \\frac{14}{3}\\)\n- \\(b = -\\frac{10}{3}\\)\n- \\(c = -\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\nPlug these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nl = \\frac{-\\left(-\\frac{10}{3}\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}}{2\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\\[\nl = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{9} + \\frac{112}{3}}}{\\frac{28}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nl = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{100 + 336}{9}}}{\\frac{28}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nl = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{436}{9}}}{\\frac{28}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nl = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{436}}{3}}{\\frac{28}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nl = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{436}}{28}\n\\]\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the roots\nSimplify the roots further if possible.\n\n## Step 7: Verify each potential solution by substitution\nSubstitute each root back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation.\n\n## Step 8: Present all valid solutions\nList all real and/or complex roots found, using consistent notation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{109}}{14}}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let g(w) be the second derivative of 13*w**4/4 - 7*w**3 + 3*w**2/2 + 13*w.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i = -516 + 3618/7.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let a = -4 - -6.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let o be 6/5*(-60)/18.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(n) be the second derivative of -n**6/300 + n**5/150 + n**4/60 - n**3/15 - n**2/2 + 2*n.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let x(y) = y**2 + y - 5.

Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(d) be the first derivative of 2/5*d**2 - 1/15*d**3 + 3 - 1/30*d**4 - 3*d.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let q(m) be the third derivative of m**7/210 + m**6/60 + m**5/60 + 8*m**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l(g) be the third derivative of -g**8/11760 - g**7/4410 + g**6/1260 + g**5/210 - g**4/8 + 9*g**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(i) = i - 2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let y(v) be the third derivative of -v**6/180 - v**5/45 - v**4/36 + 54*v**2 - 1.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l = 2 + -25.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(t) = 3*t**3 + 4*t**2 - 12*t.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z be 36/27 - (-4)/(-6). Let n(d) be the second derivative of 2*d**2 - 2*d + 1/12*d**4 + z*d**3 + 0. Suppose n(u) = 0. What is u?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Simplify the given expression for z\nFirst, simplify the given expression for z: z = 36/27 - (-4)/(-6). To do this, find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 54. Then, convert each fraction to have this common denominator: z = (36*2)/(27*2) - (4*9)/(6*9) = 72/54 - 36/54 = (72 - 36)/54 = 36/54 = 2/3.\n\n## Step 2: Find the first derivative of the given function\nNext, find the first derivative of the given function n(d) = 2*d^2 - 2*d + 1/12*d^4 + z*d^3 + 0. The derivative of d^2 is 2d, the derivative of d is 1, the derivative of d^4 is 4d^3, and the derivative of a constant is 0. The derivative of z*d^3 is z*3*d^2. So, the first derivative n'(d) = 2 - 2 + 1/3*d^3 + z*3*d^2 = 1/3*d^3 + 3*z*d^2.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the value of z into the first derivative\nSubstitute the value of z into the first derivative: n'(d) = 1/3*d^3 + 3*(2/3)*d^2 = 1/3*d^3 + 2*d^2.\n\n## Step 4: Find the second derivative of the function\nNow, find the second derivative of the function n(d) = 1/3*d^3 + 2*d^2. The derivative of 1/3*d^3 is d^2, and the derivative of 2*d^2 is 4*d. So, the second derivative n''(d) = d^2 + 4*d.\n\n## Step 5: Set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for d\nSet the second derivative equal to zero and solve for d: d^2 + 4*d = 0. Factor out d: d(d + 4) = 0. This gives two possible solutions: d = 0 or d + 4 = 0, which means d = -4.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the value of d into the original equation\nSubstitute the value of d into the original equation to find u: u = 36/27 - (-4)/(-6). This simplifies to u = 36/27 - 4/3 = (36 - 4*9)/27 = (36 - 36)/27 = 0/27 = 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor -9*b + 3*b**4 + 6 + 27*b**2 + 4*b**3 - 19*b**3 - 12*b.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Simplify the equation\nFirst, let's simplify the given equation by combining like terms:\n\n\\[\n-9b + 3b^4 + 6 + 27b^2 + 4b^3 - 19b^3 - 12b = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n3b^4 + 4b^3 - 15b^3 - 9b + 27b^2 + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\n\\[\n3b^4 - 11b^3 + 27b^2 - 9b + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n## Step 2: Factor the polynomial\nWe can try to factor the polynomial by looking for common factors or using synthetic division.\n\n## Step 3: Look for rational roots\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nThe constant term is 6, and the leading coefficient is 3.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(m) be the first derivative of -2/5*m**2 - 2/15*m**3 - 2/5*m + 7.

Suppose h**3 + h + 4*h**2 - 2*h**2 + 0*h**s = 0. What is h?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Solve the first equation for x\nTo solve the equation 0 = -5*s + 2*x + 12 for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to get -12 = -5*s + 2*x. Then, add 5*s to both sides to get -12 + 5*s = 2*x. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to get x = (-12 + 5*s)/2.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the second equation for x\nTo solve the equation -4*s + 10 = 2*x - 4*x for x, we need to isolate x. First, add 4*x to both sides of the equation to get -4*s + 10 + 4*x = 2*x. Then, subtract 2*x from both sides to get -4*s + 10 = -2*x. Finally, divide both sides by -2 to get x = 2*s - 5.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the third equation for h\nTo solve the equation h**3 + h + 4*h**2 - 2*h**2 + 0*h**s = 0 for h, we can combine like terms to get h**3 + 2*h**2 + h = 0. Then, factor out h to get h*(h**2 + 2*h + 1) = 0. The expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square trinomial that can be factored as (h + 1)**2 = 0. Therefore, h + 1 = 0, so h = -1.\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of s\nWe can use the equation x = 2*s - 5 from Step 2 to find the value of s. Since x = 0, we can substitute 0 for x and solve for s: 0 = 2*s - 5. Adding 5 to both sides gives 5 = 2*s. Dividing both sides by 2 gives s = 5/2.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of h\nWe already found the value of h in Step 3: h = -1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$",

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose -4*s + j - 3*j = 4, 5*s - j = -12.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 12 + 4/3*z**2 + 8*z = 0.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z = -89 + 89.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let x(y) be the first derivative of y**6/9 + 4*y**5/15 - y**4/6 - 4*y**3/9 - 46.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f = -8 - -11.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let a(f) be the second derivative of -f**7/63 - 7*f**6/45 - 3*f**5/5 - 11*f**4/9 - 13*f**3/9 - f**2 + 13*f.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v(n) be the first derivative of n**4 - 4*n**3 + 6*n**2 - 4*n + 32.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u be 3/(-18)*(-16)/20.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k be (((-72)/20)/2)/((-5)/25).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m be (-1 + (-1)/(-3))*9.

Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z be (-4)/14 - 423/(-1260).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let d(r) be the first derivative of -3 - 3/10*r**4 - 4/5*r + 1/5*r**2 + 8/15*r**3.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative. Use numerical methods or graphing tools to find the roots of the equation.\n\nAnswer: -2, -1, 0, 1/3\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let i(z) be the first derivative of 27*z**3/4 - 45*z**2/2 + 25*z + 11. Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let g(k) be the second derivative of -k**4/4 - k**3/2 - 18*k.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nStep 1: Identify the polynomial and ensure it is set equal to zero  \n\u2022 Rewrite the equation so that all terms are on one side of the equation, resulting in a standard form \u201cPolynomial = 0.\u201d  \n\u2022 IMPORTANT: Combine like terms if necessary, to avoid having the same power of the variable appearing multiple times.  \n\nStep 2: Determine the degree of the polynomial  \n\u2022 If the polynomial is quadratic (degree 2), prepare to use factoring methods or the quadratic formula.  \n\u2022 If the polynomial is cubic (degree 3) or higher, consider factoring by grouping, synthetic division, or the Rational Root Theorem.  \n\nStep 3: Factor out any common factor (if present)  \n\u2022 Check if there is a greatest common factor (GCF) among all terms.  \n\u2022 NOTE: Even if the GCF is a constant or a negative sign, factoring it out can simplify the remaining polynomial.  \n\nStep 4: Attempt appropriate factoring techniques or formulas  \n\u2022 For quadratic polynomials, try to factor into two binomials. If factoring by inspection fails, use the quadratic formula:  \n  x = (\u2212b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 \u2212 4ac)) / (2a)  \n\u2022 For cubic or higher-degree polynomials:  \n  1. Try grouping terms to factor.  \n  2. Use the Rational Root Theorem by testing possible roots \u00b1(factors of constant term)/(factors of leading coefficient).  \n  3. Perform synthetic or polynomial long division to reduce the polynomial\u2019s degree each time a valid root is found.  \n\nStep 5: Carefully track any special conditions or edge cases  \n\u2022 If the leading coefficient is zero after factoring out terms, the polynomial degree might be lower than it appears.  \n\u2022 If the polynomial becomes a single variable term after factoring (e.g., ax = 0), solve for x directly.  \n\u2022 IMPORTANT: Watch out for repeated factors, which result in repeated roots.  \n\nStep 6: Solve for the roots based on the factoring or formula results  \n\u2022 For each factor set to zero, solve the resulting simple equation (e.g., x + 3 = 0 \u2192 x = \u22123).  \n\u2022 If the discriminant (b\u00b2 \u2212 4ac) is negative in a quadratic, note that the polynomial has complex roots.  \n\nStep 7: Verify each potential solution by substitution  \n\u2022 Plug each root back into the original polynomial to confirm it yields zero (or a negligible value within computational tolerance).  \n\u2022 NOTE: If a candidate solution does not satisfy the original equation, discard it as an extraneous root.  \n\nStep 8: Present all valid solutions  \n\u2022 List all real and/or complex roots found, using consistent notation.  \n\u2022 Arrange multiple solutions in a clear, conventional order (e.g., numeric ascending order for real roots).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor 3 + 9/2*u**2

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let c be 2/(-8) - 81/(-36).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 4*t = -3*z + 8, 10 = -0*t + 5*t.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v = 6 + -2.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v be 2/(-30)*(-2)/20.

However, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nd^2*(d^2 - 1/5*d - 2/5) = d^2*(5d^2 - d - 2) = d^2*(5d^2 - 5d + d - 2) = d^2*(5d(d - 1) + 1(d - 2)) = d^2*(5d + 1)(d - 2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{d^2*(5d + 1)(d - 2)}$",

Since any number divided by 1 is itself, this simplifies to v = 0 + -1 = -1.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the expression for s\nNext, we evaluate the expression for s: s = v - 2/(-1 - -2). Since v = -1, we have s = -1 - 2/(-1 + 2). Simplifying the denominator, we get s = -1 - 2/1 = -1 - 2 = -3.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the expression for t(s)\nNow, we evaluate the expression for t(s): t(s) = s^2 - 2*s - 4. Substituting s = -3, we get t(-3) = (-3)^2 - 2*(-3) - 4 = 9 + 6 - 4 = 11.\n\n## Step 4: Find the prime factors of t(s)\nThe number 11 is a prime number itself. Therefore, the prime factors of t(s) are 11.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

Suppose -3*k + 8*k = 25. Suppose -5 = -3*c + 2*o + 38, -c + k*o = -36. What are the prime factors of s(c)?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Solve for c and k\nTo find the value of c, we need to solve the equation -5 = -3*c + 2*o + 38. However, we are given another equation -c + k*o = -36. We can solve for c and k using these two equations.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for c and k\nWe can rewrite the first equation as -3*c = -5 - 2*o - 38. Then, we can rewrite the second equation as c = k*o - 36. We can substitute c in the first equation with k*o - 36.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for c and k\nSubstituting c in the first equation with k*o - 36, we get -3*(k*o - 36) = -5 - 2*o - 38. Simplifying the equation, we get -3*k*o + 108 = -43 - 2*o.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for c and k\nRearranging the equation, we get -3*k*o + 2*o = -151 + 108. Simplifying further, we get -k*o = -43.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for c and k\nDividing both sides by -o, we get k = 43/o.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for c\nSubstituting k = 43/o into c = k*o - 36, we get c = (43/o)*o - 36. Simplifying, we get c = 43 - 36.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for c\nc = 7.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for k\nSubstituting c = 7 into -c + k*o = -36, we get -7 + k*o = -36.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for k\nRearranging the equation, we get k*o = -36 + 7. Simplifying further, we get k*o = -29.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for k\nDividing both sides by o, we get k = -29/o.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for k\nSince we know c = 7, we can substitute c into s(c) = c - 8 to find s(c). s(c) = 7 - 8.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for s(c)\ns(c) = -1.\n\n## Step 13: Find the prime factors of s(c)\nThe prime factors of -1 are 1 and -1.\n\n## Step 14: Write the final answer\nSince the prime factors of -1 are 1 and -1, we can write the final answer as 1 and -1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1, -1}$",

Suppose 7*s - 4*s - 38 = -2*o, 4*s - m = 2*o. Suppose -2*q - q = -s. What are the prime factors of q?\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Solve the first equation for m\nTo find the value of m, we need to isolate m on one side of the equation. The given equation is -3*m + 46 = -2*m. Subtract -2*m from both sides to get m = 46.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the second equation for s\nThe second equation is 7*s - 4*s - 38 = -2*o. Simplify the equation to get 3*s - 38 = -2*o. Add 38 to both sides to get 3*s = 38 + 2*o. Divide both sides by 3 to get s = (38 + 2*o) / 3.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the third equation for q\nThe third equation is -2*q - q = -s. Combine like terms to get -3*q = -s. Divide both sides by -3 to get q = s / 3.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the value of s into the equation for q\nSubstitute s = (38 + 2*o) / 3 into q = s / 3 to get q = ((38 + 2*o) / 3) / 3. Simplify to get q = (38 + 2*o) / 9.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of o\nWe need to find the value of o to substitute into the equation for q. However, we cannot find a unique value for o without additional information. We will assume o = 0 for simplicity.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the value of o into the equation for q\nSubstitute o = 0 into q = (38 + 2*o) / 9 to get q = (38 + 2*0) / 9. Simplify to get q = 38 / 9.\n\n## Step 7: Find the prime factors of q\nThe number 38 can be factored into 2 * 19. The number 9 is a square of 3, which is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 8: Write the prime factors of q\nThe prime factors of q are 2 and 19.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 19}$",

To do this, we add u to both sides of the equation:\n\nu = -6 + 0\nu = -6\n\n## Step 2: Substitute u into the equation 4*j + 3*t = -u + 29\nNow that we know u = -6, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n4*j + 3*t = -(-6) + 29\n4*j + 3*t = 6 + 29\n4*j + 3*t = 35\n\n## Step 3: Solve for j in terms of t\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4*j = 35 - 3*t\nj = (35 - 3*t) / 4\n\n## Step 4: Solve for t\nWe are also given the equation -4*j + t + 19 = 0. We can rewrite this equation as:\n\nt = 4*j - 19\n\n## Step 5: Substitute t into the equation from Step 3\nNow we substitute t = 4*j - 19 into the equation j = (35 - 3*t) / 4:\n\nj = (35 - 3*(4*j - 19)) / 4\nj = (35 - 12*j + 57) / 4\nj = (92 - 12*j) / 4\n4*j = 92 - 12*j\n16*j = 92\nj = 92 / 16\nj = 5.75\n\n## Step 6: Substitute j into the equation t = 4*j - 19\nNow that we know j = 5.75, we can substitute this value into the equation t = 4*j - 19:\n\nt = 4*5.75 - 19\nt = 23 - 19\nt = 4\n\n## Step 7: Substitute j and t into the equation v(p) = 3*p - 4\nNow that we know j = 5.75 and t = 4, we can substitute these values into the equation v(p) = 3*p - 4:\n\nv(j) = 3*5.75 - 4\nv(j) = 17.25 - 4\nv(j) = 13.25\n\n## Step 8: Find the prime factors of v(j)\nThe number 13.25 is not an integer, so we need to convert it to an integer by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 4:\n\nv(j) = (13.25*4) / 4\nv(j) = 53 / 4\nv(j) = 13.25\n\nSince 13.25 is not an integer, we cannot find its prime factors.\n\nHowever, we can try to find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nThe numerator 53 is a prime number.\n\nThe denominator 4 can be factored into:\n\n4 = 2 * 2\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of v(j) are 53 and 2*2.\n\nAnswer: 53, 2, 2\n\nNote: The final answer is not a single number, but rather a list of prime factors. However, I will provide it in the required format:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{53, 2, 2}$",

Here's the solution:\n\n\n## Step 1: Solve the system of equations to find the value of t and p.\nTo find the values of t and p, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\np - 4*y - 14 = -2\n-2*p + 18 = -5*y\n\n## Step 2: Express y in terms of p from the first equation.\nFrom the first equation, we can express y in terms of p:\n\np - 4*y - 14 = -2\np - 4*y = 12\ny = (p - 12)/4\n\n## Step 3: Substitute y into the second equation and solve for p.\nSubstitute y into the second equation:\n\n-2*p + 18 = -5*((p - 12)/4)\n-2*p + 18 = (-5*p + 60)/4\n-8*p + 72 = -5*p + 60\n3*p = 12\np = 4\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of y using the value of p.\nNow that we have the value of p, we can find the value of y:\n\ny = (p - 12)/4\ny = (4 - 12)/4\ny = -8/4\ny = -2\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of t using the equation -2*t = -3*x - 2.\nWe are given another equation -2*t = -3*x - 2. We need to find the value of t. However, we are not given the value of x. We can express t in terms of x:\n\n-2*t = -3*x - 2\nt = (3*x + 2)/2\n\n## Step 6: Express t in terms of p and y.\nWe can express t in terms of p and y using the first equation:\n\n-2*t - 2*t + 4*x + p = 0\n-4*t + 4*x + p = 0\n4*x - 4*t = -p\nx - t = -p/4\nx = t - p/4\n\n## Step 7: Substitute x into the equation -2*t = -3*x - 2.\nSubstitute x into the equation:\n\n-2*t = -3*(t - p/4) - 2\n-2*t = -3*t + 3*p/4 - 2\nt = 3*p/4 - 2\n\n## Step 8: Find the value of t using the value of p.\nNow that we have the value of p, we can find the value of t:\n\nt = 3*p/4 - 2\nt = 3*4/4 - 2\nt = 3 - 2\nt = 1\n\n## Step 9: Find the value of t - 0.\nNow that we have the value of t, we can find the value of t - 0:\n\nt - 0 = 1 - 0\nt - 0 = 1\n\n## Step 10: Calculate 9*((t - 0) + 0).\nNow that we have the value of t - 0, we can calculate 9*((t - 0) + 0):\n\n9*((t - 0) + 0) = 9*(1 + 0)\n= 9*1\n= 9\n\n## Step 11: Find the prime factors of 9.\nThe prime factors of 9 are 3, 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3, 3}$",

This simplifies to -3/2.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the expression with the simplified fraction\nNow, the expression becomes (-3/2) / (21/(-3164)).\n\n## Step 4: Invert and multiply to simplify the division of fractions\nTo divide by a fraction, we invert the second fraction and multiply. So, the expression becomes (-3/2) * (-3164/21).\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the numerators and denominators\nMultiplying the numerators gives us -3 * -3164 = 9492, and multiplying the denominators gives us 2 * 21 = 42.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the resulting fraction\nThe expression now is 9492/42.\n\n## Step 7: Find the prime factors of 9492\nTo find the prime factors of 9492, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n## Step 8: Continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer possible\nDividing 9492 by 2 gives us 4746. Continuing to divide by 2 gives us 2373.\n\n## Step 9: Find the prime factors of 2373\n2373 can be divided by 3, giving us 791. 791 can be divided by 7 and 113, both of which are prime numbers.\n\n## Step 10: List the prime factors\nThe prime factors of 9492 are 2, 2, 3, 7, 113.\n\n## Step 11: List the prime factors of the denominator 42\nThe prime factors of 42 are 2, 3, 7.\n\n## Step 12: Combine the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator\nSince we are looking for the prime factors of the entire expression, we combine the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator, which are 2, 2, 3, 7, 113 and 2, 3, 7.\n\n## Step 13: Remove duplicates\nRemoving duplicates, we get 2, 3, 7, 113.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 3, 7, 113}$",

List the prime factors of h(-2).\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Find the first derivative of the given function h(m)\nTo find the first derivative of h(m), we'll apply the power rule of differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1). We'll apply this rule to each term in the function.\n\n## Step 2: Differentiate each term in the function\nThe function is h(m) = -m^4/2 - 4*m^3/3 - m^2 + m - 1. Applying the power rule:\n\n- The derivative of -m^4/2 is -2m^3.\n- The derivative of -4*m^3/3 is -4m^2.\n- The derivative of -m^2 is -2m.\n- The derivative of m is 1.\n- The derivative of -1 is 0.\n\n## Step 3: Combine the derivatives of each term\nCombining the derivatives of each term, we get h'(m) = -2m^3 - 4m^2 - 2m + 1.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate h(-2)\nNow, we need to evaluate h(-2) by substituting m = -2 into the original function h(m):\n\nh(-2) = -(-2)^4/2 - 4*(-2)^3/3 - (-2)^2 + (-2) - 1\n= -16/2 + 32/3 - 4 - 2 - 1\n= -8 + 32/3 - 5\n= -8 + 32/3 - 15/3\n= -8 + 17/3\n\n## Step 5: Simplify h(-2)\nTo simplify h(-2), we need to find a common denominator for -8 and 17/3, which is 3. So, we rewrite -8 as -24/3:\n\nh(-2) = -24/3 + 17/3\n= -7/3\n\n## Step 6: Find the prime factors of h(-2)\nNow, we need to find the prime factors of -7/3. Since -7/3 is a fraction, we'll find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator separately.\n\n## Step 7: Find the prime factors of -7\n-7 is a prime number itself.\n\n## Step 8: Find the prime factors of 3\n3 is also a prime number itself.\n\n## Step 9: Write the prime factors of h(-2)\nSince -7/3 has prime factors of -7 and 3, we can write the prime factors of h(-2) as -7 and 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3, -7}$",

List the prime factors of i.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\nI can only provide a solution in the format you specified for the first question. For the subsequent questions, I will provide the solution in the requested format.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the Input Number\nThe problem statement does not provide a specific number to factorize. However, it seems we need to find the prime factors of a given expression or value. Let's consider the expression 0*t - 208 = -2*i - 3*t and 0 = -2*t + 4.\n\n## Step 2: Handle Negative Values\nSince the expression involves negative values, we need to isolate the variable i. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to solve for i.\n\n## Step 3: Isolate the Variable i\nWe can rewrite the equation 0 = -2*t + 4 as 2*t = 4. Then, we can solve for t: t = 4/2 = 2.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute t into the first equation\nSubstitute t = 2 into the equation 0*t - 208 = -2*i - 3*t: 0*2 - 208 = -2*i - 3*2.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation\n0 - 208 = -2*i - 6, -208 = -2*i - 6.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for i\nAdd 6 to both sides: -202 = -2*i. Then, divide both sides by -2: i = 101.\n\n## Step 7: Find the prime factors of i\nSince i = 101, which is a prime number, the prime factors of i are 101.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{101}$",

What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

In this case, stop.\n\nStep 2: Handle Negative Values  \n\u2022 If N is negative, temporarily convert it to its absolute value for factorization.  \n\u2022 NOTE: Record that the prime factors are the same as if N were positive.\n\nStep 3: Initialize a List of Prime Factors  \n\u2022 Create an empty list or container named prime_factors.\n\nStep 4: Divide Out Factor 2 (the Smallest Prime)  \n\u2022 While N is divisible by 2, append 2 to prime_factors and update N by dividing N by 2.\n\nStep 5: Divide Out Odd Candidates  \n\u2022 Set a divisor variable d to 3.  \n\u2022 While d \u00d7 d \u2264 N, do the following:  \n  \u2022 If N is divisible by d, append d to prime_factors and update N by dividing N by d.  \n  \u2022 Otherwise, increase d by 2 (move on to the next odd number).\n\nStep 6: Check If the Remaining N Is Greater Than 1  \n\u2022 If after the above steps N is still greater than 1, it must be a prime factor.  \n\u2022 Append N to prime_factors.\n\nStep 7: Verify the Result  \n\u2022 Multiply all numbers in prime_factors together.  \n\u2022 IMPORTANT: Confirm the product equals the original absolute value of N.  \n\u2022 If the product does not match, re-check each division step for errors.\n\nStep 8: Return or List the prime_factors  \n\u2022 Present the prime_factors list as the final answer.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since 2 is a prime number, the only prime factor of \\( u \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of \\( u \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f be -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6.

Let m be q(3). Suppose -4*g = -4*k - 148, m = -2*k - 2*k. List the prime factors of g.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\nI'll solve the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Evaluate q(3)\nTo find m, we first need to evaluate q(3). The function q(u) is defined as 2*u - 6. So, we substitute u = 3 into the function:\n\nq(3) = 2*3 - 6\nq(3) = 6 - 6\nq(3) = 0\n\n## Step 2: Express m in terms of k\nWe are given that m = -2*k - 2*k. Simplify the expression:\n\nm = -2*k - 2*k\nm = -4*k\n\n## Step 3: Solve for k\nWe are given that -4*g = -4*k - 148. We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by -4:\n\ng = k + 37\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of k\nSince we know that m = q(3) = 0, we can substitute m = 0 into the equation m = -4*k:\n\n0 = -4*k\nk = 0\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of g\nNow that we know k = 0, we can substitute k into the equation g = k + 37:\n\ng = 0 + 37\ng = 37\n\n## Step 6: Find the prime factors of g\nThe number 37 is a prime number itself.\n\n## Step 7: List the prime factors of g\nSince 37 is a prime number, the only prime factor of g is 37.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{37}$",

Since the equation is -2*r + 0 = -8, we can subtract 0 from both sides to get -2*r = -8.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for r\nDivide both sides of the equation by -2 to solve for r: r = -8 / -2 = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation 2 - 18 = -r*f for f\nTo find the value of f, we need to isolate f on one side of the equation. Since the equation is 2 - 18 = -r*f, we can add 18 to both sides to get 20 = -r*f.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for f\nDivide both sides of the equation by -r to solve for f: f = -20 / r = -20 / 4 = -5.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation 1 = -f*d + 49 for d\nTo find the value of d, we need to isolate d on one side of the equation. Since the equation is 1 = -f*d + 49, we can subtract 49 from both sides to get -48 = -f*d.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for d\nDivide both sides of the equation by -f to solve for d: d = -48 / -f = -48 / -5 = 9.6.\n\n## Step 7: Find the prime factors of d\nThe number 9.6 can be written as 9.6 = 9.6 = 96/10 = 48/5 = 16*6/5 = 16*6/5 = 2^4*3*2/5 = 2^5*3/5.

Let z be (7 - y) + 32 + 1. Suppose z = 3*r - 5*n, 0 = 4*r - r + n - 22. List the prime factors of r.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\nI can help you solve the problem step by step, but I need to clarify that the problem statement seems to be incomplete or incorrectly formatted. However, I'll do my best to provide a solution based on the information given.\n\nGiven the problem statement:\n-y = d - 8\ny + 0*d - 4*d + 2 = 0\nz = (7 - y) + 32 + 1\nz = 3*r - 5*n\n0 = 4*r - r + n - 22\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to clarify the relationships between y, d, z, r, and n. However, without a clear connection between these variables, we can only attempt to solve for some of them.\n\nLet's start by solving the first equation for y:\n\n-y = d - 8\ny = 8 - d\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation for y:\n\ny + 0*d - 4*d + 2 = 0\ny - 4d + 2 = 0\ny = 4d - 2\n\nSince both expressions equal y, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n8 - d = 4d - 2\n\nNow, let's solve for d:\n\n8 - d = 4d - 2\n8 + 2 = 5d\n10 = 5d\nd = 2\n\nNow that we have d, we can find y:\n\ny = 8 - d\ny = 8 - 2\ny = 6\n\nNext, let's solve the third equation for z:\n\nz = (7 - y) + 32 + 1\nz = (7 - 6) + 32 + 1\nz = 1 + 32 + 1\nz = 34\n\nNow, let's solve the fourth equation for r:\n\n0 = 4*r - r + n - 22\n0 = 3r + n - 22\n\nWe still need more information to solve for r and n. However, we can express n in terms of r:\n\nn = 22 - 3r\n\nNow, let's solve the equation z = 3*r - 5*n for r:\n\n34 = 3r - 5(22 - 3r)\n34 = 3r - 110 + 15r\n34 = 18r - 110\n34 + 110 = 18r\n144 = 18r\nr = 8\n\nNow that we have r, we can find n:\n\nn = 22 - 3r\nn = 22 - 3(8)\nn = 22 - 24\nn = -2\n\nSince we have found the values of r and n, we can list the prime factors of r:\n\nr = 8\nThe prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 2\n\nPlease note that without more information, we cannot find the prime factors of z or the relationship between y, d, and n.

In this case, stop.\n\nStep 2: Handle Negative Values  \n\u2022 If N is negative, temporarily convert it to its absolute value for factorization.  \n\u2022 NOTE: Record that the prime factors are the same as if N were positive.\n\nStep 3: Initialize a List of Prime Factors  \n\u2022 Create an empty list or container named prime_factors.\n\nStep 4: Divide Out Factor 2 (the Smallest Prime)  \n\u2022 While N is divisible by 2, append 2 to prime_factors and update N by dividing N by 2.\n\nStep 5: Divide Out Odd Candidates  \n\u2022 Set a divisor variable d to 3.  \n\u2022 While d \u00d7 d \u2264 N, do the following:  \n  \u2022 If N is divisible by d, append d to prime_factors and update N by dividing N by d.  \n  \u2022 Otherwise, increase d by 2 (move on to the next odd number).\n\nStep 6: Check If the Remaining N Is Greater Than 1  \n\u2022 If after the above steps N is still greater than 1, it must be a prime factor.  \n\u2022 Append N to prime_factors.\n\nStep 7: Verify the Result  \n\u2022 Multiply all numbers in prime_factors together.  \n\u2022 IMPORTANT: Confirm the product equals the original absolute value of N.  \n\u2022 If the product does not match, re-check each division step for errors.\n\nStep 8: Return or List the prime_factors  \n\u2022 Present the prime_factors list as the final answer.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18. What are the prime factors of u?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the problem and find the prime factors of \\( u \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the value of \\( u \\):**\n\n   The expression given is \\( u = 20 + (-18) \\).\n\n   \\[\n   u = 20 - 18 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the prime factors of \\( u \\):**\n\n   Now that we know \\( u = 2 \\), we need to find its prime factors.\n\n   - The number 2 is a prime number itself. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since 2 is a prime number, the only prime factor of \\( u \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of \\( u \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f be -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6. What are the prime factors of (f + -7)*(0 + -38)?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow the steps carefully:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the expression for \\( f \\)\n\nThe expression given for \\( f \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{-7 \\times (-2)}{-14} \\times -6\n\\]\n\n#### Step 1.1: Simplify \\(-7 \\times (-2)\\)\n\n\\[\n-7 \\times (-2) = 14\n\\]\n\n#### Step 1.2: Simplify \\(\\frac{14}{-14}\\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{-14} = -1\n\\]\n\n#### Step 1.3: Simplify \\(-1 \\times -6\\)\n\n\\[\n-1 \\times -6 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( f = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( (f + -7) \\)\n\n\\[\nf + -7 = 6 + (-7) = 6 - 7 = -1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( (0 + -38) \\)\n\n\\[\n0 + -38 = -38\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( (f + -7) \\times (0 + -38) \\)\n\n\\[\n(-1) \\times (-38) = 38\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Find the prime factors of 38\n\nThe number 38 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n38 = 2 \\times 19\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 19 are prime numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe prime factors of \\( (f + -7) \\times (0 + -38) \\) are 2 and 19.\n\nAnswer: 2, 19\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = -7*q + 5*q - 50.
