Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3.

If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms). Such observations connect back to analyzing the original function\u2019s smoothness, curvature, and asymptotic properties in a broader mathematical context.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms). Such observations connect back to analyzing the original function\u2019s smoothness, curvature, and asymptotic properties in a broader mathematical context.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms). Such observations connect back to analyzing the original function\u2019s smoothness, curvature, and asymptotic properties in a broader mathematical context.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

However, we must note that the variable used in the original problem is j, not z. Assuming the correct variable is j, we can proceed:\n\n\\[ q(z) = -\\frac{j^6}{5} - \\frac{j^4}{8} - 6j \\]\n\nDifferentiate q(z) with respect to j:\n\n1. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{j^6}{5} \\) is \\( -\\frac{6j^5}{5} \\).\n2. The derivative of \\( -\\frac{j^4}{8} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4j^3}{8} \\).\n3. The derivative of \\( -6j \\) is \\( -6 \\).\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\\[ -\\frac{6j^5}{5} - \\frac{3j^3}{2} - 6 \\]\n\nReasoning: We have followed the steps to find the third derivative of q(z) with respect to z. We started with the expression for c(j), found its first and second derivatives, and then used the second derivative as the expression for q(z). We then found the third derivative of q(z) with respect to j.\n\nFinal Answer: -\\frac{6j^5}{5} - \\frac{3j^3}{2} - 6",

Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\\[ k + 3k^k \\]\n\nNow, let's find the first derivative with respect to k:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dk}(k + 3k^k) \\]\n\n- The derivative of \\( k \\) is \\( 1 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( 3k^k \\) is \\( 3k^{k-1} \\).\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\\[ 1 + 3k^{k-1} \\]\n\nTo find the second derivative, we need to differentiate the first derivative with respect to k:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dk}(1 + 3k^{k-1}) \\]\n\n- The derivative of \\( 1 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( 3k^{k-1} \\) is \\( 3(k-1)k^{k-2} \\).\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\\[ 3(k-1)k^{k-2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of the given expression with respect to k is:\n\\[ 3(k-1)k^{k-2} \\]\n\nHowever, I must point out that the original problem statement is unclear, and the variable l is not defined. Therefore, the final answer may not be accurate without further clarification.\n\nReasoning: The original problem statement is unclear, and the variable l is not defined. I assumed it to be a typo and replaced it with k. The correct solution is based on this assumption.\nFinal Answer: 3*(k-1)*k**(k-2)",

Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3.

For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms). Such observations connect back to analyzing the original function\u2019s smoothness, curvature, and asymptotic properties in a broader mathematical context.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms). Such observations connect back to analyzing the original function\u2019s smoothness, curvature, and asymptotic properties in a broader mathematical context.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate).

Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1. Express the given function in a suitably simplified or factored form. Leverage algebraic manipulations to isolate each term in a manner that reveals the underlying structure (e.g., separate polynomial-like terms, identify products of separate functions, or factor out constants as needed).\n\n2. Use the linearity of the differentiation operator: for any function F expressed as a sum \u2211 f\u1d62, the derivative dF/dx is the sum of the individual derivatives \u2211 (df\u1d62/dx). Exploit this property to handle each term separately.\n\n3. For each term, apply the fundamental differentiation rules:  \n   \u2022 Power Rule: d/dx[x\u207f] = n x\u207f\u207b\u00b9 when x is the variable of differentiation.  \n   \u2022 Product Rule: d/dx[uv] = u dv/dx + v du/dx for functions u, v that each depend on x.  \n   \u2022 Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f\u2032(g(x)) g\u2032(x) whenever f is applied to the function g(x).  \n   \u2022 Quotient Rule or equivalent manipulations as necessary.\n\n4. If higher-order derivatives are required, repeat the differentiation process with the newly obtained expression. Again, use linearity to handle each resulting term separately and systematically apply the power, product, and chain rules as needed. Simplify after each differentiation step.\n\n5. Observe any cancellations or constant factors that emerge in intermediate steps. Recognize that constants (with respect to the differentiation variable) vanish upon differentiation and that terms can simplify or drop out when repeated differentiation is performed.\n\n6. In cases where functions involve multiple variables, clarify the roles of each variable. For partial derivatives, treat other variables as constants and apply single-variable rules with respect to the chosen differentiation variable.\n\n7. Recognize the role of each differentiation law within a broader theoretical context:  \n   \u2022 Linearity underscores that derivatives behave like linear transformations, connecting to abstract linear algebra.  \n   \u2022 The chain rule reflects the behavior of composite functions, illustrating functorial properties in category-theoretic settings.  \n   \u2022 Repeated differentiation connects to power series expansions and higher-order behavior of analytic functions, bridging to more advanced topics such as Taylor expansions and differential equations.\n\n8. After each differentiation step, verify the results by ensuring consistency with known identities or by substituting specific values (if appropriate). Simplify thoroughly to obtain the most elegant final expression.\n\n9. Conclude by examining the final derivative or higher-order derivative for structural insights (e.g., determining the degree of a resulting polynomial term or the appearance of constant terms). Such observations connect back to analyzing the original function\u2019s smoothness, curvature, and asymptotic properties in a broader mathematical context.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let n(t) be the second derivative of 5*t**3/3 + 11*t**2/2 - t.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(a) be the second derivative of a**7/70 - 3*a**6/40 + a**5/10 + 9*a**2/2 - 4*a.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let b(i) be the third derivative of -i**5/24 + 5*i**4/48 + 5*i**3/6 + 9*i**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 4 = -3*o - 2*h + 3*h, -5*h + 20 = 5*o.

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let v(j) be the third derivative of -j**8/588 - 11*j**7/1470 - 3*j**6/280 - j**5/420 + j**4/168 - 6*j**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let d(j) be the third derivative of 1/33*j**3 + 1/132*j**4 + 0 - 1/660*j**6 + 2*j**2 + 0*j - 1/330*j**5.

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let h(x) be the second derivative of 7/24*x**4 - 4*x + 0*x**2 + 0 - 1/4*x**3 + 1/60*x**6 - 1/8*x**5.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let r(g) be the second derivative of 16*g**7/147 + 8*g**6/15 + 73*g**5/70 + 43*g**4/42 + 11*g**3/21 + g**2/7 + 4*g.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 4*a = -8, 0 = -3*n - a - 2 + 6.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 0 = 3*m + 207 - 222.

The equation provided does not follow the standard format of a polynomial equation, and the variable \"i\" is used in a way that suggests it might be a complex number or an imaginary unit, but the equation does not clearly define what \"i\" represents.\n\nHowever, assuming \"i\" is a variable and the equation is meant to be solved as a polynomial equation in terms of \"i\", I'll provide a general approach to solving it.\n\n### Step 1: Clarify the Variable \"i\"\nFirst, we need to understand what \"i\" represents. In mathematics, \"i\" is often used to denote the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. However, without further context, it's unclear how \"i\" is defined in this problem.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Equation\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[ 0 = 3m + 207 - 222 \\]\n\nThis equation seems unrelated to the polynomial equation involving \"i\". It appears to be a simple linear equation in terms of \"m\". Let's solve it:\n\n\\[ 0 = 3m - 15 \\]\n\n\\[ 3m = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 5 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Address the Polynomial Equation\nThe original problem statement seems to be a mix-up. Assuming the polynomial equation involving \"i\" is meant to be solved as is, without further clarification on \"i\", we cannot proceed accurately.\n\nHowever, if we were to ignore the linear equation and focus solely on the polynomial:\n\n\\[ \\frac{104}{3}i^2 - \\frac{434}{3}i^4 + 92i^3 - 196i^m + 16i = 0 \\]\n\nGiven the powers of \"i\" (i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1, i^m is unclear without further context), we can simplify the equation:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{104}{3} - \\frac{434}{3} + 92i - 196i^m + 16i = 0 \\]\n\nSince \"i^m\" is unclear, let's focus on the terms we can simplify:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{538}{3} + (92i - 196i^m + 16i) = 0 \\]\n\nWithout knowing the value of \"m\", we cannot accurately simplify further.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the unclear definition of \"i\" and the mixed nature of the problem, it's challenging to provide a definitive solution. The equation seems to be a mix of a linear equation and a polynomial equation involving complex numbers, but without further clarification, we cannot accurately solve it.\n\nIf you could provide more context or clarify the definition of \"i\" in this problem, I'd be happy to assist further.",

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Factor -32 - 224*l**2 + 163*l + 13*l + 30*l**3 - 56*l**2 + 70*l**3.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Simplify the given expression\nThe given expression is \\(-32 - 224l^2 + 163l + 13l + 30l^3 - 56l^2 + 70l^3\\).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let t(a) be the third derivative of -1/45*a**4 + 0*a**3 - 5*a**2 + 8/225*a**5 + 0 - 7/900*a**6 + 0*a.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let g = -1 + 1.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m(n) be the second derivative of -n**6/300 + n**5/150 + n**4/60 - n**3/15 - n**2/2 + 2*n.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let o(s) be the second derivative of s**6/30 + 4*s**5/15 + 2*s**4/3 + 5*s**3/6 + s.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let l(g) be the third derivative of -g**8/11760 - g**7/4410 + g**6/1260 + g**5/210 - g**4/8 + 9*g**2.

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient.

In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k(i) = i - 2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

We have l = 2 and r = -20 - l.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the values of l and r into the equation\nSubstitute l = 2 and r = -20 - l = -20 - 2 = -22 into the equation.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nThe equation becomes -2/7*y**4 - 4/7*y**(-22) - 2/7*y**2 + 0*y + 0 = 0.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the negative exponent\nSince y**(-22) = 1 / y**22, the equation becomes -2/7*y**4 - 4/7*(1 / y**22) - 2/7*y**2 + 0*y + 0 = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply both sides by 7*y**22 to eliminate the fractions\nMultiplying both sides by 7*y**22 gives -2*y**26 - 4 - 2*y**2 + 0*y + 0 = 0.\n\n## Step 6: Rearrange the equation\nRearrange the equation to standard polynomial form: -2*y**26 - 2*y**2 - 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 7: Factor out -2\nFactor out -2 from the equation: -2*(y**26 + y**2 + 2) = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for y\nDivide both sides by -2: y**26 + y**2 + 2 = 0.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the quadratic equation\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of y**2. Let u = y**2, then the equation becomes u**13 + u + 2 = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for u\nUnfortunately, this equation does not have an elementary solution. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n## Step 11: Apply the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of p/q, is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\n## Step 12: Find the factors of the constant term and the leading coefficient\nThe constant term is 2, and its factors are \u00b11, \u00b12. The leading coefficient is 1, and its factors are \u00b11.\n\n## Step 13: Test possible rational roots\nTest the possible rational roots: \u00b11, \u00b12.\n\n## Step 14: Test p = 1\nSubstitute p = 1 into the equation: 1**13 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \u2260 0.\n\n## Step 15: Test p = -1\nSubstitute p = -1 into the equation: (-1)**13 + (-1) + 2 = -1 - 1 + 2 = 0.\n\n## Step 16: Factor the polynomial\nSince p = -1 is a root, we can factor the polynomial as (y**2 + 1)*(y**24 - y**22 + y**20 -... + y**2 - y + 1).\n\n## Step 17: Solve for y\nUnfortunately, this factorization does not lead to a simple solution. However, we can try to find a pattern in the remaining polynomial.\n\n## Step 18: Observe the pattern\nObserve that y**24 - y**22 + y**20 -... + y**2 - y + 1 is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio -y**2.\n\n## Step 19: Sum the geometric series\nThe sum of the geometric series is (1 - (-y**2)**12) / (1 - (-y**2)).\n\n## Step 20: Simplify the expression\nSimplify the expression: (1 + y**24) / (1 + y**2).\n\n## Step 21: Equate to zero\nEquate the expression to zero: (1 + y**24) / (1 + y**2) = 0.\n\n## Step 22: Solve for y\nSolve for y: 1 + y**24 = 0.\n\n## Step 23: Solve for y**24\nSubtract 1 from both sides: y**24 = -1.\n\n## Step 24: Solve for y\nTake the 24th root of both sides: y = \u00b1(1/\u221a2)^(1/12).\n\n## Step 25: Simplify the expression\nSimplify the expression: y = \u00b1(1/\u221a2)^(1/12).\n\n## Step 26: Rationalize the denominator\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by (\u221a2)^(1/12): y = \u00b1(1/\u221a2)^(1/12) * (\u221a2)^(1/12) / (\u221a2)^(1/12).\n\n## Step 27: Simplify the expression\nSimplify the expression: y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step 28: Simplify further\nSimplify further: y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step 29: Simplify the exponent\nSimplify the exponent: y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step 30: Simplify the expression\nSimplify the expression: y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step 31: Rationalize the denominator\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by (\u221a2)^(1/6): y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6) * (\u221a2)^(1/6) / (\u221a2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step 32: Simplify the expression\nSimplify the expression: y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step 33: Simplify the exponent\nSimplify the exponent: y = \u00b1(1/2)^(1/6).\n\n## Step

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let y = -31119/80 + 389.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose -4*s + j - 3*j = 4, 5*s - j = -12.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Suppose 12 + 4/3*z**2 + 8*z = 0.

We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Solve 102*q**5 - 552*q**2 - 13*q**5 - 48 - 240*q**3 + 336*q + 58*q**5 + 357*q**4 = 0 for q.\n\n\n\nYou must strictly follow the following output format:\nReasoning: [Your reasoning here]\nFinal Answer: [Your final answer here]<|end_of_turn|>\n<|assistant|>\n## Step 1: Combine like terms\nThe given equation can be simplified by combining like terms:\n\n102*q**5 - 13*q**5 - 13*q**5 + 58*q**5 - 240*q**3 + 357*q**4 + 336*q - 48 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n136*q**5 - 240*q**3 + 357*q**4 + 336*q - 48 = 0\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of q:\n\n357*q**4 - 240*q**3 + 136*q**5 + 336*q - 48 = 0\n\n## Step 3: Factor out the greatest common factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of q.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let q(w) = -w**3 - 8*w**2 + 10*w + 12.

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let x(y) be the first derivative of y**6/9 + 4*y**5/15 - y**4/6 - 4*y**3/9 - 46.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let a(f) be the second derivative of -f**7/63 - 7*f**6/45 - 3*f**5/5 - 11*f**4/9 - 13*f**3/9 - f**2 + 13*f.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3.

Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2. Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\). Solving it directly can be complex, so we can simplify or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, let's simplify and solve it step by step:\n\n1. Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let k be (((-72)/20)/2)/((-5)/25).

Find q such that u(q) = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third derivative of the given function and then determine the value of \\( q \\) such that this third derivative equals zero.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nThe function given is:\n\n\\[ f(a) = -\\frac{a^8}{952} - \\frac{8a^7}{1785} - \\frac{a^6}{340} + \\frac{a^5}{255} + 22a^2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the First Derivative\n\nTo find the first derivative \\( f'(a) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( a \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{a^8}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{a^6}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{a^5}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\)\n5. \\(22a^2\\) becomes \\(44a\\)\n\nThus, the first derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'(a) = -\\frac{8a^7}{952} - \\frac{56a^6}{1785} - \\frac{6a^5}{340} + \\frac{5a^4}{255} + 44a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Second Derivative\n\nNow, differentiate \\( f'(a) \\) to find the second derivative \\( f''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{8a^7}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{6a^5}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{5a^4}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44a\\) becomes \\(44\\)\n\nThus, the second derivative is:\n\n\\[ f''(a) = -\\frac{56a^6}{952} - \\frac{336a^5}{1785} - \\frac{30a^4}{340} + \\frac{20a^3}{255} + 44 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Third Derivative\n\nDifferentiate \\( f''(a) \\) to find the third derivative \\( f'''(a) \\):\n\n1. \\(-\\frac{56a^6}{952}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{952}\\)\n2. \\(-\\frac{336a^5}{1785}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{1680a^4}{1785}\\)\n3. \\(-\\frac{30a^4}{340}\\) becomes \\(-\\frac{120a^3}{340}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{20a^3}{255}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{60a^2}{255}\\)\n5. \\(44\\) becomes \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the third derivative is:\n\n\\[ f'''(a) = -\\frac{336a^5}{952} - \\frac{1680a^4}{1785} - \\frac{120a^3}{340} + \\frac{60a^2}{255} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Third Derivative Equal to Zero\n\nWe need to find \\( q \\) such that \\( f'''(q) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ -\\frac{336q^5}{952} - \\frac{1680q^4}{1785} - \\frac{120q^3}{340} + \\frac{60q^2}{255} = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( q \\)\n\nThis equation is a polynomial equation in \\( q \\).

Combine terms by finding a common denominator or simplifying each term.\n2. Use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the polynomial simplifies to a form where we can easily find \\( q \\). In practice, you would use a calculator or software to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exact value of \\( q \\) depends on solving the polynomial equation derived from the third derivative.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Differentiate \\( \\frac{45}{2}z^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{45}{2}z^2\\right) = \\frac{45}{2} \\cdot 2z^{2-1} = 45z\n   \\]\n\n3. Differentiate \\( 25z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(25z) = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. Differentiate the constant \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}(11) = 0\n   \\]\n\nCombining these results, the first derivative \\( i(z) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Derivative\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\( \\frac{81}{4}z^2 - 45z + 25 \\).\n\nTo factor a quadratic expression of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add to \\( b \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\), \\( b = -45 \\), and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n1. Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\). Factor \\(p\\) out of the equation:\n\n\\[\np(-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Polynomial\nNow, we need to solve the polynomial:\n\n\\[\n-2p^4 + 12p^3 - 26p^2 + 24p - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let m be (-1 + (-1)/(-3))*9.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative.

Here, the constant term is \\(-8\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(-2\\).\n\nFactors of \\(-8\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8\\).\nFactors of \\(-2\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Test Possible Roots\nTest these possible roots in the polynomial:\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^4 + 12(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 24(1) - 8 = -2 + 12 - 26 + 24 - 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a root.\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Polynomial\nSince \\(p = 1\\) is a root, we can factor the polynomial as \\((p - 1)\\) times another polynomial. Use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by \\(p - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n1 & -2 & 12 & -26 & 24 & -8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8\\).\n\n### Step 8: Solve the Cubic Polynomial\nNow solve \\(-2p^3 + 10p^2 - 16p + 8 = 0\\).\n\n1. **\\(p = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   -2(1)^3 + 10(1)^2 - 16(1) + 8 = -2 + 10 - 16 + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\(p = 1\\) is a repeated root.\n\n### Step 9: Factor Further\nFactor the cubic polynomial using \\(p - 1\\) again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n1 & -2 & 10 & -16 & 8 \\\\\n  &    & -2 & 8 & -8 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & -2 & 8 & -8 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe quotient is \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8\\).\n\n### Step 10: Solve the Quadratic Polynomial\nSolve \\(-2p^2 + 8p - 8 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -2\\), \\(b = 8\\), \\(c = -8\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(-2)(-8)}}{2(-2)}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{-8 \\pm 0}{-4}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solutions to the equation are \\(p = 0\\), \\(p = 1\\) (with multiplicity 2), and \\(p = 2\\).\n\nAnswer: 0, 1, 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let z be (-4)/14 - 423/(-1260).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

The derivative of -k^4/4 is -k^3.\n2. The derivative of -k^3/2 is -3k^2/2.\n3.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

Factor i(s).\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first derivative of the given function and then factor the resulting expression. Let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Differentiate the Function\n\nThe given function is:\n\n\\[ f(z) = \\frac{27}{4}z^3 - \\frac{45}{2}z^2 + 25z + 11 \\]\n\nTo find the first derivative, \\( i(z) \\), we differentiate each term with respect to \\( z \\).\n\n1. Differentiate \\( \\frac{27}{4}z^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{27}{4}z^3\\right) = \\frac{27}{4} \\cdot 3z^{3-1} = \\frac{81}{4}z^2\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate \\( ac \\):\n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 = \\frac{2025}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. We need two numbers that multiply to \\( \\frac{2025}{4} \\) and add to \\(-45\\).\n\nThis can be challenging with fractions, so let's try factoring by completing the square or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nPlug in the values:\n\n- \\( a = \\frac{81}{4} \\)\n- \\( b = -45 \\)\n- \\( c = 25 \\)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-45)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{81}{4} \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ = 2025 - 2025 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n\nCalculate the root:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-45) \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2 \\times \\frac{81}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45}{\\frac{162}{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{45 \\times 4}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{180}{162} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{10}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ i(z) = \\frac{81}{4}(z - \\frac{10}{9})^2 \\]\n\nThis is the factored form of the derivative. The repeated root is \\( z = \\frac{10}{9} \\).\n\nAnswer: (9*s - 10)**2/4\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Find p such that -26/7*p**3 + 12/7*p**4 - 2/7*p**5 - 8/7*p + 24/7*p**2 + 0 = 0.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-\\frac{26}{7}p^3 + \\frac{12}{7}p^4 - \\frac{2}{7}p^5 - \\frac{8}{7}p + \\frac{24}{7}p^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by multiplying every term by 7 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n-26p^3 + 12p^4 - 2p^5 - 8p + 24p^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Terms\nRearrange the terms in descending order of powers of \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n-2p^5 + 12p^4 - 26p^3 + 24p^2 - 8p = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor\nNotice that each term has a factor of \\(p\\).

For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a).

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\nBegin by expressing the polynomial in a normalized form, ensuring that all coefficients are clearly identified.  \nExamine the degree of the polynomial. For low-degree polynomials (particularly quadratic, cubic, or quartic), apply known formulae (e.g., the quadratic formula or Cardano\u2019s method) to locate exact roots.  \nIf the polynomial has integer or rational coefficients, employ the Rational Root Theorem to test candidate roots of the form p/q, where p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Once a suspected root is confirmed by substitution, factor out the corresponding linear factor using polynomial long division or synthetic division.  \nContinue factoring repeatedly until either all roots and factors are found or the remaining polynomial is irreducible over the field of interest (commonly \u211a). In the latter case, consider irreducibility criteria (e.g., Eisenstein\u2019s Criterion) to confirm an absence of further rational factors.  \nWhere factorization is nontrivial, investigate advanced methods: for instance, employ the Factor Theorem systematically, analyze solvable Galois groups for higher-degree polynomials, or use numerical approximations (iterative root-finding algorithms, such as Newton\u2019s method) when no closed-form solutions exist.  \nObserve that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complete factorization in the complex field, but factorization over \u211d or \u211a may require techniques from field theory or ring theory to establish precisely which roots and factors remain within the chosen domain.  \nWhen a root is discovered, interpret it in broader algebraic contexts (for example, relating its existence to extension fields if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a). Such connections highlight the interplay between polynomial equations, field extensions, and the algebraic structures governing solvability.  \nWhenever possible, select strategies\u2014like exploiting symmetry or applying transformations\u2014that simplify the polynomial before attempting direct computation. Such approaches can illuminate hidden structure (e.g., depressed cubics) and often lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Let u(a) be the third derivative of -a**8/952 - 8*a**7/1785 - a**6/340 + a**5/255 + 22*a**2.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

However, I can guide you through the solution for the last question.\n\n## Step 1: Solve the equation -b + 4 = -3 for b\nTo find the value of b, we need to isolate b on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-b + 4 - 4 = -3 - 4\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-b = -7\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n\n\\[\nb = 7\n\\]\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the value of b into the equation -1 = -4*p + b\nNow that we know b = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[\n-1 = -4*p + 7\n\\]\n\n## Step 3: Solve for p\nTo isolate p, we need to get all the terms involving p on one side of the equation. Let's add 4*p to both sides:\n\n\\[\n-1 + 4*p = 7 + 4*p\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 4*p from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-1 = 7\n\\]\n\nThis is a contradiction, indicating that there is no solution for p.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation 5*p + 10 = 5*i for i\nSince we found that there is no solution for p, we cannot proceed with this equation.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven the contradiction in the previous steps, we cannot find a valid value for i.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No solution}$",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

Let's move the term \\( 2v \\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\( 2v \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2v - 2v = 2v - 2v - 33\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n0 = -33\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\( v \\)\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( v \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0. However, this is not possible because dividing by zero is undefined. This indicates that the equation \\( 2v - 33 = 0 \\) has no solution for \\( v \\), meaning there is no value of \\( v \\) that satisfies the equation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there is no solution for \\( v \\), there are no prime factors of \\( v \\).\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{0}$",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110.

However, I can guide you through the solution for the given problem.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\n\nThe given equation is:\n\n\\[\n0 \\times t - 208 = -2i - 3t\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the equation\n\nFirst, let's move all terms involving \\(t\\) to one side and constants to the other side:\n\n\\[\n0 \\times t + 3t = -2i + 208\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3t = -2i + 208\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\(t\\)\n\nTo isolate \\(t\\), we need to get rid of the \\(i\\) on the right side. Since \\(i\\) is an imaginary unit, we can't directly subtract it from 208. However, we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[\n3t = 208 - 2i\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the prime factors of 208\n\nThe number 208 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n208 = 2^4 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince the question asks for the prime factors of \\(i\\), and \\(i\\) is an imaginary unit, it does not have real prime factors. However, the question seems to be asking for the prime factors of the expression \\(208 - 2i\\), not \\(i\\) itself. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(208\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(13\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 13\n\nPlease note that the question about \\(i\\) seems to be a trick question, as \\(i\\) is not a number with real prime factors. The correct interpretation is to find the prime factors of the real number \\(208\\).",

    "raw_response": "<|user|>\n1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n \u2265 2 into primes (up to ordering).  \n2) Ensure n \u2265 2; if n \u2264 1, no prime factorization exists.  \n3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  \n   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  \n   b) While p \u2264 \u221an, check divisibility of n by p.  \n   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  \n   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  \n4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  \n5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard\u2019s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  \n6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  \n7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nQuestion: Suppose -3*b = 2*b - 110. What are the prime factors of b?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\) and find the prime factors of \\(b\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate the variable \\(b\\)\nFirst, we want to get all the terms involving \\(b\\) on one side of the equation. Let's move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-5b = -110\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\(b\\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-110}{-5}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nb = 22\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the prime factors of \\(b\\)\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n22 = 2 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of \\(b\\) are 2 and 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe prime factors of \\(b\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(11\\).\n\nAnswer: 2, 11\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let u = 20 + -18. What are the prime factors of u?\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the problem and find the prime factors of \\( u \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the value of \\( u \\):**\n\n   The expression given is \\( u = 20 + (-18) \\).\n\n   \\[\n   u = 20 - 18 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the prime factors of \\( u \\):**\n\n   Now that we know \\( u = 2 \\), we need to find its prime factors.\n\n   - The number 2 is a prime number itself. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since 2 is a prime number, the only prime factor of \\( u \\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of \\( u \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Let f be -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6.

However, I noticed that the problem statement seems to be incomplete. It appears to be a series of questions with different problems, but the last one is incomplete. I'll solve the first three problems as per the given instructions.\n\n## Step 1: Solve the first equation -3*b = 2*b - 110\nTo solve the equation \\(-3b = 2b - 110\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(b\\). First, we'll move the term \\(2b\\) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \\(2b\\) from both sides.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation\n\\(-3b - 2b = 2b - 2b - 110\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\(-5b = -110\\)\n\n## Step 3: Solve for b\nNow, we need to solve for \\(b\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-5\\).\n\n\\(b = \\frac{-110}{-5}\\)\n\n\\(b = 22\\)\n\n## Step 4: Find the prime factors of b\nNow that we have \\(b = 22\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 22 can be factored into:\n\\(22 = 2 \\times 11\\)\n\nBoth 2 and 11 are prime numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 11}$\n\n## Step 5: Solve the second equation u = 20 + -18\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the value of \\(u\\).\n\n\\(u = 20 + (-18)\\)\n\n\\(u = 20 - 18\\)\n\n\\(u = 2\\)\n\n## Step 6: Find the prime factors of u\nNow that we know \\(u = 2\\), we need to find its prime factors. The number 2 is a prime number itself.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$\n\n## Step 7: Solve the third equation f = -7*(-2)/(-14)*-6\nTo solve the problem, we need to simplify the expression for \\(f\\).\n\n\\(f = \\frac{-7 \\times (-2)}{-14} \\times -6\\)\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression for f\n\\(-7 \\times (-2) = 14\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{14}{-14} = -1\\)\n\n\\(-1 \\times -6 = 6\\)\n\nSo, \\(f = 6\\)\n\n## Step 9: Calculate (f + -7)\n\\((f + -7) = 6 + (-7)\\)\n\n\\((f + -7) = 6 - 7\\)\n\n\\((f + -7) = -1\\)\n\n## Step 10: Calculate (0 + -38)\n\\((0 + -38) = -38\\)\n\n## Step 11: Calculate (f + -7) * (0 + -38)\n\\((-1) \\times (-38) = 38\\)\n\n## Step 12: Find the prime factors of 38\nThe number 38 can be factored into:\n\\(38 = 2 \\times 19\\)\n\nBoth 2 and 19 are prime numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 19}$",
