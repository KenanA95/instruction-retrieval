Write instructions to solve calculus__differentiate problems as if you are a university professor teaching graduate-level mathematics.

The instructions should:
1. Use precise mathematical language and notation
2. Provide rigorous explanations with theoretical foundations
3. Assume strong mathematical background and familiarity with advanced concepts
4. Focus on elegant and efficient solution approaches
5. Include insights into why certain techniques work and their mathematical significance
6. Mention connections to broader mathematical theory where relevant

Your output should contain ONLY the instructions themselves, with no additional text, explanations, or meta-commentary. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks.

Do not directly use any of the problems in the provided dataset in the instructions.
