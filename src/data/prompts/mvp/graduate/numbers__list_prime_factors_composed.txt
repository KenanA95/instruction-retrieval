1) Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which guarantees the unique factorization of any integer n ≥ 2 into primes (up to ordering).  
2) Ensure n ≥ 2; if n ≤ 1, no prime factorization exists.  
3) For a straightforward approach, use trial division:  
   a) Initialize a factor candidate p = 2.  
   b) While p ≤ √n, check divisibility of n by p.  
   c) If p divides n, record p and replace n with n / p; repeat until n is no longer divisible by p.  
   d) Increment p to the next integer (if p = 2, proceed to 3; then increment by 2 for efficiency).  
4) If n > 1 at the end of the trial division, n itself is prime and should be included among the factors.  
5) For large n, more sophisticated factorization algorithms (e.g., Pollard’s Rho, Quadratic Sieve, or Elliptic Curve Factorization) may be employed to reduce computational complexity.  
6) Note that these methods exploit various number-theoretic properties, such as the structure of residue classes, to find nontrivial divisors faster than naive trial division.  
7) Recognize that prime factorization underlies numerous applications in algebraic number theory, cryptography, and complexity theory, illustrating the broad relevance of factoring techniques.
