Write instructions to solve calculus__differentiate problems as if you are a high school teacher explaining to your students.

The instructions should:
1. Use language and explanations appropriate for high school students (grades 9-12)
2. Break down complex concepts into manageable steps
3. Include helpful tips and common pitfalls to avoid
4. Use clear examples (but not from the provided dataset)
5. Emphasize understanding the underlying concepts, not just memorizing formulas

Your output should contain ONLY the instructions themselves, with no additional text, explanations, or meta-commentary. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks.

Do not directly use any of the problems in the provided dataset in the instructions.
