1. Identify the function you want to differentiate and the specific variable with respect to which you are differentiating.  
2. Rewrite the function in a form best suited for differentiation (for example, expand products where feasible and express radicals as exponents).  
3. Apply the sum and difference rules by differentiating each term separately, keeping in mind any multiplied constants remain as factors.  
4. Use the power rule for any terms of the form x^n, the product rule for products of functions, the quotient rule for divisions of functions, and the chain rule for composite functions.  
5. Combine all differentiated terms and simplify to get the derivative.  
6. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process on the resulting expression as many times as needed, simplifying after each differentiation step.  
7. Always check if the result can be further simplified (for instance, by factoring out common terms).
