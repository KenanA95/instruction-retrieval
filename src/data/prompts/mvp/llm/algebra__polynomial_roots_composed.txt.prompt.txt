Write instructions to solve algebra__polynomial_roots problems that are specifically optimized for a language model to follow.

The instructions should:
1. Be structured in a clear, step-by-step format that's easy for an LLM to parse and follow
2. Use explicit markers and signposting (e.g., "Step 1:", "IMPORTANT:", "NOTE:")
3. Break complex reasoning into atomic steps with clear transitions
4. Include explicit instructions for handling edge cases and common errors
5. Use consistent terminology and notation throughout
6. Minimize ambiguity by being precise about what operations to perform when
7. Include verification steps to check the correctness of intermediate results

Your output should contain ONLY the instructions themselves, with no additional text, explanations, or meta-commentary. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks.

Do not directly use any of the problems in the provided dataset in the instructions.
