1. Start with the smallest prime (2).  
2. Divide the number by the prime repeatedly until it no longer divides evenly, recording each factor.  
3. Move to the next prime.  
4. Continue dividing and recording factors until the result is 1 or the current prime exceeds the square root of the remaining value.  
5. If the remaining value is greater than 1, record it as a prime factor.
