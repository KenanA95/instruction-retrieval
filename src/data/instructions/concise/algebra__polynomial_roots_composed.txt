Rewrite the polynomial in standard form, combining like terms if needed.  
Factor out any greatest common divisor.  
For quadratics, attempt factoring or use the quadratic formula to find roots.  
For higher-degree polynomials, apply the Rational Root Theorem to identify possible rational roots.  
Use synthetic or long division to test each candidate root and reduce the degree of the polynomial as roots are found.  
Continue factoring or solving the reduced polynomials until fully decomposed.  
Substitute each root into the original equation to verify correctness.
