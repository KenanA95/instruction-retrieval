Step 1: Identify the polynomial and ensure it is set equal to zero  
• Rewrite the equation so that all terms are on one side of the equation, resulting in a standard form “Polynomial = 0.”  
• IMPORTANT: Combine like terms if necessary, to avoid having the same power of the variable appearing multiple times.  

Step 2: Determine the degree of the polynomial  
• If the polynomial is quadratic (degree 2), prepare to use factoring methods or the quadratic formula.  
• If the polynomial is cubic (degree 3) or higher, consider factoring by grouping, synthetic division, or the Rational Root Theorem.  

Step 3: Factor out any common factor (if present)  
• Check if there is a greatest common factor (GCF) among all terms.  
• NOTE: Even if the GCF is a constant or a negative sign, factoring it out can simplify the remaining polynomial.  

Step 4: Attempt appropriate factoring techniques or formulas  
• For quadratic polynomials, try to factor into two binomials. If factoring by inspection fails, use the quadratic formula:  
  x = (−b ± √(b² − 4ac)) / (2a)  
• For cubic or higher-degree polynomials:  
  1. Try grouping terms to factor.  
  2. Use the Rational Root Theorem by testing possible roots ±(factors of constant term)/(factors of leading coefficient).  
  3. Perform synthetic or polynomial long division to reduce the polynomial’s degree each time a valid root is found.  

Step 5: Carefully track any special conditions or edge cases  
• If the leading coefficient is zero after factoring out terms, the polynomial degree might be lower than it appears.  
• If the polynomial becomes a single variable term after factoring (e.g., ax = 0), solve for x directly.  
• IMPORTANT: Watch out for repeated factors, which result in repeated roots.  

Step 6: Solve for the roots based on the factoring or formula results  
• For each factor set to zero, solve the resulting simple equation (e.g., x + 3 = 0 → x = −3).  
• If the discriminant (b² − 4ac) is negative in a quadratic, note that the polynomial has complex roots.  

Step 7: Verify each potential solution by substitution  
• Plug each root back into the original polynomial to confirm it yields zero (or a negligible value within computational tolerance).  
• NOTE: If a candidate solution does not satisfy the original equation, discard it as an extraneous root.  

Step 8: Present all valid solutions  
• List all real and/or complex roots found, using consistent notation.  
• Arrange multiple solutions in a clear, conventional order (e.g., numeric ascending order for real roots).
