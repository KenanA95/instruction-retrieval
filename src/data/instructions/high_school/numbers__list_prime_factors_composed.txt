1. Choose a number you want to factor into primes. Always begin by trying to divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.  
2. If 2 divides your number evenly (i.e., there is no remainder), then 2 is a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.  
3. When 2 no longer divides the number, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Repeat the same process, testing divisibility and dividing as many times as possible.  
4. Continue checking and dividing by each subsequent prime number (5, 7, 11, 13, …) until the result is reduced to 1 or until the remaining number itself is a prime.  
5. List all the distinct primes that divided your number during this process. These are the number’s prime factors.  

Tips and Pitfalls:  
• A common mistake is to jump to larger prime numbers too quickly. Always move in order of increasing primes to avoid missing any factors.  
• If the number is large, you only need to test primes up to its square root. Any factor larger than the square root would have already appeared as a smaller factor.  
• Be careful to keep dividing by the same prime factor until it no longer works before moving on.  
• Check your final set of prime factors by multiplying them together to ensure you get the original number.  

Example (not from the provided data):  
• Suppose you want to factor 84.  
• Start with 2: 84 ÷ 2 = 42, so 2 is a prime factor. Keep dividing by 2 as long as it works: 42 ÷ 2 = 21, which still works. Then 21 ÷ 2 is not an integer, so move on.  
• Next check 3: 21 ÷ 3 = 7, so 3 is a prime factor. 7 ÷ 3 is not an integer, so move on.  
• The next prime is 5, which doesn’t divide 7. Then 7 is itself prime, so you stop.  
• The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.
