1. Examine the polynomial to determine its degree (the highest exponent).  
2. Simplify the polynomial if necessary, combining like terms and putting it into standard form.  
3. If the polynomial is quadratic (degree 2):  
   a. Try to factor it by finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the linear term, if it factors easily.  
   b. If factoring directly is not possible, use the quadratic formula:  
      x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a).  
4. If the polynomial is cubic (degree 3) or higher:  
   a. Look for a common factor that can be factored out.  
   b. Apply techniques such as grouping, synthetic division, or the Rational Root Theorem to find potential rational roots.  
   c. Use polynomial long division or synthetic division with any discovered roots to reduce the polynomial’s degree.  
   d. Continue factoring the reduced polynomial.  
5. If factoring is not straightforward, consider numerical methods (graphing, numerical root approximation methods) to approximate any irrational or complex roots.  
6. After finding each root, check it by substituting it back into the original polynomial to verify that it satisfies the equation.
