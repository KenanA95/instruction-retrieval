1. Write down the number you want to factor.  
2. Begin with the smallest prime number, which is 2.  
3. Check if 2 divides the number without leaving a remainder.  
   • If yes, note 2 as a prime factor. Continue dividing by 2 until it no longer divides evenly.  
   • If no, move on to the next prime number (3, then 5, 7, 11, and so on).  
4. Continue checking divisibility by each prime, noting it as a factor and dividing out the prime repeatedly until it no longer divides.  
5. Stop when your reduced number is 1. The prime factors you recorded are the distinct prime factors of the original number.
