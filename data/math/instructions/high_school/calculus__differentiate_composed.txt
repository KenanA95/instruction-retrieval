1. Identify each term in the function you want to differentiate. Recognize that a “term” is a piece of the function separated by addition or subtraction signs.

2. Recall the power rule: if you have xⁿ, its derivative is n · x^(n-1). This applies to any variable raised to a constant power.

3. When differentiating a constant (a number without a variable), the result is 0.

4. Apply the sum rule: the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives.

5. If you see a product of two functions, use the product rule:
   d/dx [u(x) · v(x)] = u'(x) · v(x) + u(x) · v'(x).
   Be sure to carefully differentiate each factor at the right step.

6. If you see one function divided by another, use the quotient rule:
   d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = [v(x) · u'(x) - u(x) · v'(x)] / [v(x)]².
   Carefully apply each piece of this formula to avoid mistakes.

7. For composite functions (functions inside functions), use the chain rule:
   d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) · g'(x).
   Identify the “inner” function and the “outer” function first; this step helps you apply the rule correctly.

8. After applying the appropriate rule(s), simplify your answer by combining like terms, factoring if needed, or reducing fractions.

9. Always check your steps for common errors, like forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative in the chain rule, mixing up negative signs, or incorrectly treating constants.

10. Practice with simple examples first. For instance, if you want to differentiate x³ + 4x - 7:
   a. Differentiate x³: 3x².  
   b. Differentiate 4x: 4.  
   c. Differentiate -7: 0.  
   d. Combine them: 3x² + 4.

11. Remember that understanding why these rules work (e.g., from the limit definition of the derivative) can help you avoid memorization mix-ups and build deeper problem-solving skills.
