1. Identify the variable and rewrite each term in a form suitable for the power rule.  
2. Apply the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = n·x^(n−1).  
3. For constants, the derivative is 0.  
4. For sums, differentiate each term separately and add the results.  
5. If needed, apply the product rule: d/dx(u·v) = u'·v + u·v'.  
6. If needed, apply the quotient rule: d/dx(u/v) = (v·u' − u·v') / v².  
7. If needed, apply the chain rule: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))·g'(x).  
8. For higher-order derivatives, repeat the differentiation process as required.
